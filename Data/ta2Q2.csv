0,This seems like a good deal in terms of used entry-level luxury—a 2015 Acura TLX 2.4 with 50k miles for $15.9k:
1,nice color combo on the TLX.  But I really don't like these without the tech package.  At least the 2018s base have a lot more stuff on them.
2,"Yeah, the Tech package for the TLX is expensive (c.$3700 iirc), but it does add some nice stuff—blind spot monitors, cross traffic alert, ELS sound system, Milano leather seats (which even smell nice imho), rain-sensing wipers, built-in navi (which I have used a few times), and AcuraLink concierge (which I've not yet used at all). Plus, as you say, the 2018s and later get CarPlay/AndroidAuto as well as Acurawatch."
3,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out.  It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable.  Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person.  Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."
4,The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap.
5,"Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."
6,Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?
7,"Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."
8,"Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers?  If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be  your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
9,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
10,"Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store.  It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer.  It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing,  not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those.  Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership.  The difference is subtle, but perceptable.  It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves.  After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).  To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."
11,"I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work. But I wanted to briefly say that I'm still really enjoying the driving experience with my leased 2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech. Great car for the money imho. All best wishes out there to the chronic car buyers, etc."
12,Still on the list.  Just have not been looking actively right now.
13,I sent you a message
14,"A new and mostly positive review by Kelly Blue Book of the TLX. The reviewer says the TLX is likely to be more reliable than some other luxury cars in the long run, which is good news for me since I'm hoping to keep mine for quite a while...."
15,If I do manage to upgrade to a TLX it would have to be with a 10 year horizon.
16,Thanks. I'll give it a try at some point to merge my accounts.
17,"I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty."
18,They usually go up as the year goes along. Christmas ind Presidents’ Day are good options.
19,"Yeah, I was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. But so far we haven't regretted it. The CR-V is also an awesome vehicle. We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
20,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time."
21,"I like the 2 screen set up, for just the reason you said.  More real estate, and dedicated map when needed."
22,"My local Cadillac dealer has their last ATS available for lease for $200 a month with ""0 down"":"
23,I would take it.  without even looking at the link!
24,That dealer has the same GM as my BMW dealer- the guy that ran off all but two of the BMW salespeople and added dealer packs and a high doc fee.
25,"The fine lrint for all says ""plus dealer add-ons."" Oh boy."
26,The CTS looks like a smokin’n deal if your name is
27,"so the car is $199/month, and the mop and glow stuff is another $175?"
28,If I was 25 years older I might an XT5 as well.
29,"Its a hard knock life when 0-60 in 6.5 secs in an SUV is called ""a slug."""
30,"Well, the translation for ""slug"" could be this:"
31,Wait... an SUV doesn't handle like a sedan?! Good thing we have reporters to bust scandals like this wide open!
32,"I wouldn't call the XT5 I had as a loaner a slug by any means, but I didn't like it much. Felt big, heavy, and it had that awful BMW-style beer-tap gearshift which I hated."
33,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
34,"What's the storage capacity in GB?  If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
35,Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....
36,"That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time.  I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home.  Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
37,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back.  I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond.  No more, never again, thank you very much.  And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs.  All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore.  In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip.  These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist.  Some things do get better."
38,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
39,"May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?"
40,Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
41,"Oh, you mean like this?"
42,Yeah but the BIG ones.
43,You asked for it …
44,"Oh, it even has a stacker.  This new technology will change everything."
45,"A new name, Shifty?"
46,A minor glitch we are working on . But it's still me
47,"I believe my XF has a 10gb hard drive, it allows me to upload 10 CDs.  So 10 on the HD, one in the player = the Spinal Tap nirvana of 11."
48,Another little feature I like on the TLX is the built-in compass....
49,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!
50,"I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown.  Does it show speed limit, too?  The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
51,"Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination."
52,"Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem."
53,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
54,"Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
55,Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.
56,"Plus it’s not a lightweight, and us pushing an AWD system."
57,So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..
58,Thinking about it....
59,"Stinger interests me, but not the horrible lease rates."
60,"The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side."
61,So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
62,"A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year."
63,"So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6.  The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
64,"Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
65,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring."
66,"I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me).   I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it."
67,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
68,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much.  Enjoy the pics, too.  Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX.  But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
69,"The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
70,How many miles do you have on the TLX now?  After going on a couple of test rides with
71,"I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
72,That says a lot that you've driven it that much.   The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
73,"I will buy another sedan at some point.  Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring,  TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO.  I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs.  A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have.  She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive.  It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner.  As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me.  My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases!  ugh"
74,"Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
75,"If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
76,"I haven't ruled out the Passat.  I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own.  As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
77,I have an old friend that just testified to the following:
78,"The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but...."
79,"Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
80,"The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle."
81,Declining sales last month for most ELL cars means bargains can be found....
82,Jag XE didn't even make the list; that can't be good...
83,"Probably a Jaguar is in a different category higher than ""entry-level luxury."" I just copied and pasted that list that someone compiled. I notice it's also missing the Cadillac ATS, I guess because the ATS is a little smaller?"
84,Jaguar XE sales are down considerably from 2017
85,"""Danger Will Robinson!"""
86,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX."
87,"What classes do you teach?  I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models.  I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather. The higher seating position in the TLX, similar to my Accord is a plus.  I don't like the lower seating stance of the new Accord."
88,I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!
89,"I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class.  When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors.  One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII.  The stories and insight that she shared, wow.  I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't."
90,A pic from today....
91,That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine.  28.4 would be an improvement.  I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.
92,My 320i would average 38 on the highway... The 4 cyl and ZF is a great match for Performance and MPG BTW my MPG was in Comfort mode
93,"I get 30 mpg on my commute quite consistenly, as long as I keep light on the pedal and the traffic is average.  My best highway was nearly 40, going downhill from Atlanta to Tampa, but it drops quickly on any disturbance, or uphill.  It’s more like 35 on a typical trip."
94,"I don't what it is with some cars. My Mini gets 26 mpg, no matter what I do, or how I drive. 26 +/-  1."
95,You need a new car.
96,"Don't remind me. As usual, I'm hunting unicorns."
97,"Mpg on a trip from Louisville to Cincinnati and back in the TLX (c. 200 miles for the round trip). It was raining off and on both ways, sometimes heavily—and so AC, headlights, and wipers. Speed was c.65-75 mph."
98,"After owning that VW Passat TDI, no one will ever again impress me with MPG numbers.  Ain't gonna happen, sorry."
99,"It’s cool, as long as you don’t mind 40 times limit NOx emissions."
100,"I truly believe that for once, the EPA is underrating cars..."
101,Where is that Passat today?
102,"All true.  I never said they weren't cheating.  But man, when those German engineers cheat, they do a heck of a job!"
103,I’m really surprised that I haven’t seen more 2.0 diesels fixed and for sale.   Seems like there would be demand.
104,I think most of them are sitting unfixed in lots across the US....
105,"In addition to the pollution, the Passat's not an entry-level luxury car."
106,"I may not be, but it's nice.  I just drove a rental TDI in Scotland for a week and I didn't feel much deprived vs. my 430 GC.  The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good.  Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left).  Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money.  Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI."
107,"Yes, buy why?"
108,"There's a good aftermarket tune for those old TDI's.  I experienced one in a loaner bug at my preferred shop.  Of course, it might be spewing 80X the current standard emissions now."
109,"I don't really understand the question, but I'm the last one to place some kind strict categories with a checklist.  People buy whatever they want and if they want to cross shop Escalade with Mazda Miata, it's weird, but it's their privilege.   All I just meant to say my dad's A4 TDI is loud (it's still in the family, my nephey has it) at highway speeds and you definitely know it's a downsized tractor engine with slightly better vibration dampening and noise insulation good enough for you hear the radio at somewhat loud setting.  Europeans liked those TDIs and Benz's old (slow, noisy and clunky) diesels long years before they bought into the ""diesel will save the planet and we just have it in our showroom"" lie, luxury or not."
110,Here are the kind of roads I get to enjoy driving on with my new TLX. Eat your hearts out city slickers. During the five minutes I was out of my car the road was completely empty in both directions.
111,Love that!  I was just up in the mountains on a similar road with the Mini--and I realized how old the suspension has gotten after many miles. This car is really tired--it just couldn't hold the line when pushed. It was like driving a skateboard.
112,I'm hoping to take a couple of test drives over the weekend - 2015 TLX V6 w/ Tech. One FWD and the other AWD. Both priced around $25K.
113,I used to live out in the country and drive roads like that all the time.  Now I live in the inner city and drive highly congested pothole infested ...
114,"I live 4 miles from Downtown Cincinnati, and I can be on a road like that within 10 minutes."
115,Even nicer in a RWD performance car where you can use the throttle on/off to help yourself around the corners.
116,"Sadly, most of the rural roads near me here in Colorado are dead straight."
117,About 5 minutes for me...
118,Looks just like my town
119,"Growing up in NYC, Manhattan when I see a picture like this my thoughts are"
120,"i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering.  Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD?  I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor.    Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD."
121,"Alex on Autos, on the other hand, thinks the TLX A-Spec awd is close in performance to an uplevel BMW or MB—and for a lot less."
122,or buy it out at the end!
123,"My TLX already had almost 300 miles when I bought it. It had actually been traded with a dealer in TN at some point (I could tell from the window sticker). 300 miles is obviously small potatoes when compared with 36,000, but with a lease do they give you that credit so your actually mileage limit is 36,300 at the end of three years?"
124,"I think I forgot to mention, why the hell is Acura putting GREEN X tires on a SH-AWD model (referring to KBB's review of a test model with those tires!?)?"
125,I have enjoyed listening to people takes on the Accord v TLX.. Interesting reading.
126,"sorry to hear about your tranny issue.  Seems though that is a really rare occurence on a BMW, with the ZF?  I thought those were pretty bulletproof.  But, can always get a lemon anything.  The X2, will that replace the 330, or your other car (a 4 series?)"
127,So what happens at startup?
128,Somehow I hadn't heard of this before—but I'm glad I seemingly got it on the TLX.
129,"Not sure what 1/4 mile times you are looking at, but they are far from close. Of course, the Alfa costs a helluva lot more."
130,Alfa: 11.8 seconds at 122 mph through the quarter-mile
131,"After the car sits for 12 hours And on start up the car lurches forward like it's not completely in natural. It doesn't make any noises like gears grinding, it has gotten worse in the 15 months I've had the car. Part of me says, screw it, I have less than 2 yrs left on the lease, the other half says, BMW knows there is a problem but they don't want to fix it."
132,I haven't read anyone issues like it mine with the ZF either on Bimmerfest or Bimmerpost. The ZF is a pretty build proof unit. The X2 will replace Ricks 328GT. He really liked the one I had as a loaner.
133,"also 1.1 secs, not a tenth."
134,"Ben in the BMW world, it was not unheard of getting a new BMW lease for 1% of MSRP, that was a good indicator that you got a good deal. When I was looking to replace my 320i, I was offered V6 TLXs for under 1%, reason, they weren't selling... Would you share your deal you got on your TLX?"
135,"You know the 1/4 miles times and trap speed means nothing today.  Most cars are going to be fast, fast enough to get you in trouble. My 330i will run the 1/4 in 13 sec's and about 100. 0-60 times in the high 5's (stock) drop a stage 1 onto (like I did) 0-60 in the mid 5 to low 5, and 1/4 times and speed goes up. We have a neighbor who has his new M5 w/comp package on order and all he talks about is how fast it goes. Some of us are betting that an accident will happen shortly after he gets it."
136,"given the road quality and congestion around here, and the level of police interest, it quickly becomes all about bragging rights.  Not anything you can actually use (or in any realistic way need)."
137,YUP...
138,"I am forced to agree.  A 12 second quarter mile is an impressive thing, but I doubt I will ever again do that.  Or at least it would be a very rare occurrence.  But I do like acceleration."
139,My problem with the T&C is traction. One front tire powered by a 3.6 pulling 4800 lbs behind it results in nothing but wheelspin if you try to get going too quick.
140,"It's complicated because of my trade-in, but if somehow that could be taken out I'd be at less than 1% of msrp for my monthly payment."
141,Figure roughly $30/mo for every $1000 of trade equity.
142,"A 12.9 quarter mile is currently acceptable for me- until I finally install the M Performance locking differential- at that point I will probably bump the power up a bit, for more fun at HPDEs, the local drag strip, and the occasional stop light grand prix..."
143,"My new gas station mpg calculation for the 2018 TLX 2.4 was as follows: 345 miles/10.18 gallons=33.9 mpg. My car's trip computer says 34.1 mpg for those same miles, which is obviously very close. This was for about 70% highway miles. This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?"
144,It's fun to watch people in love.
145,No mountain or canyon roads where you live?  Or nearby?
146,"I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground.    There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."
147,"In the last 7 months my 330i has averaged 28.4, lets not forget that the last 3 months I've had the AC running all the time, the best highway was on a trip to Austin TX, 37 MPG, I really don't think this is bad for a car that can run mid-to low 5 0-60."
148,According to this article....
149,That's better than I can do in the relatively light weight 7-speed Optima with the 1.6T engine.  28.4 would be an improvement.  I'm gonna peg my lifetime average at 27 mpg.
150,"He certainly seems To be quite picky.  And if you want a 200k Porsche, buy one!"
151,"Today I went with my TLX and my folding bike to a park on the outskirts of town called—believe it or not—Pope Lick Park. About a 20 minute drive each way, 60-70 mph on the highway, and then some two lane roads. Got about 35 mpg on the little trip with ac on the whole way, which seemed pretty good. We have good parks here in Louisville, and some have very nice bike paths. In fact, I think the ""Louisville Loop"" in its various places is one of the better urban/rural bike paths in the country. Anyway, here's one of my uses of my entry-level luxury sedan for today—and in the last pic you can see my ugly mug to see the face of the guy who has been bothering you off and on for almost 20 years here. By the way, the volume dial on the steering wheel of the TLX has been copied for the 2018 Accord. But having driven both, I can say that although they look almost the same the Accord's is a cheap feeling piece of hard plastic, while the TLX's is a rubberized dial that feels and works better."
152,Sure thing. Most of these were taken shortly after delivery.
153,I love the interior...   looks like you are missing a pedal.
154,"Hope some other ""entry level luxury-sport"" owners will share their pix too.++"
155,"If its the 3.6, it should be way better than 6.5. I think it may be the 2.0T, unless I'm getting my ATS owners mixed up."
156,I love the red...it goes so good with the interior colors.
157,"Mine is a RWD ""Premium Performance"" with the 3.6. The 0-60 time is supposedly mid-5s. All I know is that it is really quick, especially in the midrange. Haven't bothered with gas mileage calculations yet. I haven't done a lot of highway driving with it so the computer numbers it displays would likely be pretty dismal (I haven't looked at it recently). It is just a super-fun car to drive. I wish the interior had a little less black and a little more Kona Brown, but I'm glad it isn't all black."
158,"My mpg on my big commute to get my son—Louisville to Lexington and back—was one of my excuses for getting the new TLX. I thought I'd take a significant mpg hit for moving from an Accord to an Acura, but if the mpg meter on the new TLX is accurate the mpg is very similar. I got c.36 mpg on the way over and c.38 mpg on the way back. This is a c.80 mile drive with AC on going c.70-75 mph. I know I'm getting premium gas instead of regular, but I'm still impressed that mpg is the same as a CVT car that weighs c.200 lbs less...."
159,"With still more than half a tank of gas in my new TLX curiosity got the better of me on the mpg front, and I decided to fill it up so that I could do a manual calculation to check against the car's trip calculator. I drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33."
160,"I can tell you that my TSX mpg computer averages about 5% high over 142K miles, quite consistently.  Every other readout that I can check (speed, miles, temp, etc.) are dead on.  It never reads low, just varying degrees of high.  The marketing guys won this one -- a tiny percentage of people hand-calculate MPG."
161,"On some BMWs you can get into a service menu that lets you adjust the OBC mpg calculation. Funny thing, every BMW I've owned with an OBC has tended to be 5% optimistic. Ditto for the Mini. However, the 2 Series OBC is usually 8%"
162,"Brought the folding bike in my TLX to another nice park today. The twisty rural roads are fun even when following the speed limit (which I pretty much did). The auto-dimming mirror in this car has a rather thin frame. The Acura Link button lets you call a concierge for restaurant recommendations and reservations, theater/concert tix, etc, and I'm subscribed to it for free for a certain number of months—I forget how many. I think I need to take a trip and use it. The other button is similar to an Onstar emergency button, I guess. My Honda Accord didn't have either of these buttons. Below a few pix of the strangely idyllic bike paths around Louisville. Being from California, I still marvel at the lack of crowds in some places here even after 20 years...."
163,TLX pix—engine compartment edition.
164,The TLX is certainly dressed up under hood.  You got my curiosity about the radiator fans.  The Accord has two as well. They look very similar overall.
165,"To take my mind off other events, I got some pics of the ATS engine and trunk compartment today."
166,"Haven't you heard?  Almost no one looks under the hood in the daylight these days, let alone at night.  That's part of how BMW got away with eliminating the dipstick lo these many years ago."
167,Wait—you mean you can't manually check your oil level with new BMWs??
168,That’s correct.
169,"Oh, you can manually check. You manually push some sequence of buttons and a level appears in the cluster that ""estimates"" how much oil you have. At least, that was the case in my 2008, so I'm assuming that is still the case."
170,"They've improved the sensors quite a bit on the Fxx and Gxx cars. I'd prefer to have a dipstick as a backup, but on the newer cars I'm comfortable with the sensor."
171,"Before I had it, I thought ""rain sensing wipers"" fell in the realms of unneeded and even silly features. But yesterday driving my son c. 80 miles in traffic with variable rain conditions the darn thing worked pretty well. Not worrying about how fast to put the windshield wipers on made it slightly easier to carry on a conversation and worry about the other aspects of driving. Obviously not an essential feature, but it can actually be useful imho."
172,Alex on Autos likes the performance of the A-Spec TLX....
173,"It is an absolute gas to drive. Much faster than any car I've ever owned so I need to watch myself. The handling is something else too, as it has far more capability in that department than I am used to using."
174,"I have a good friend who owns a late model Cadillac SRX, I disremember the year (2016? 2017? Whatever.)"
175,"I think that KBB review is ""fair.""  The TLX just isn't a real sports sedan.  If you bought one thinking you'll go canyon carving with your BMW and Audi friends, you may be disappointed.   If you got one thinking you got the better Accord, chances are you'll be happy."
176,cute ad.  and the new Forte is a nice looking car!
177,"I'm fairly confident that the majority of people driving cars today couldn't tell the difference if only one wheel were driven, never mind on which axle."
178,"Once in a while we've actually had that question in Forums: ""How can I tell if my car is FWD or RWD?"""
179,"considering how many damned cars have black interiors, I'm pretty sure even that is not a prerequisite."
180,It
181,"No excuse for this, really. It has enough HP to be entertaining."
182,sounds like something I might like.  Sucker for hatches of this style.  I can take my chances with a 14 second quarter.  Super comfy seats are a big plus.
183,"I do not find it attractive at all. The previous version was far better looking IMO, and inside, this one is not good at all. As a GM fan this car is a huge disappointment. Top that off with performance that is mid-pack at best and I suspect the model may not make it to the end of its 4-year production contract with PSA at the former GM plant in Russelsheim, at least for North American markets."
184,"After a week apart I got to drive my new TLX for more than an hour today, all in Sport mode, which is the way to go for the 2.4. One highway run of c.70 mph with AC had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. If that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my Accord was) then the highway mpg is very close to what I got in the 2016 Accord. Still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets."
185,"It has been several years since I last used a spare tire.  And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan.  I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was.  My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours."
186,"Henry, I am with you.  No spare tire is a hot button issue.  Last blow out I had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere.  At least with the donut on I could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store.  The tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping."
187,I noticed the lack of a spare tire on my test drive of the CPO 2015 TLX last weekend. I'm very much on the fence about this issue.
188,the plastic insert should pop out.  I know for sure in the ILX it did.
189,"Almost everything about the TLX seems to be significantly higher in quality than an Accord, and often that higher quality comes with some added weight. I assume some designers several years ago said, more or less: here's a way we can save c.40 pounds all at once. And how many people really change their own tires at this point?"
190,"Keep the comparison review of the Accord/TLX/CR-V coming!   Speaking of which, do you find the TLX to be significantly quieter than the Accord and how so?  I do believe you can run regular gas without damage in the TLX without too much performance degradation...if Premium gas is recommended and not required."
191,"Premium is recommended in my RDX too, but runs fine on regular.  The engine is identical best as I can tell to the Pilot, Accord, etc.  I think it even has the same code designation.  Same compression ratio, even same power output.  The TLX, not sure how much different it is than the Accord motor.  Odds are it is fine on regular but might cut performance slightly but only at higher revs."
192,"with tires, it is not just a matter of not wanting to change your own.  You can still call AAA.  The difference is, if you have a spare, they put it on and you are on your way.  No spare, and you are riding in the front seat of a tow truck, or standing on the side of the road waiting for an Uber, while you hope that the tow truck drops your car someplace that can find a tire right away.  Just hope you don't get a flat when they are closed!"
193,"My wife's car doesn't have a spare..  or, the one before this one..     Since 2013, no issues."
194,"Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much."
195,"I am planning to stop at the Acura dealer Saturday afternoon, for their ""summer event"".  Free lunch and a test drive, what's not to love?  Will give the wife a chance to scope and (and hopefully drive) an RDX, and will also spend some time in a TLX too (won't need to drive that one)."
196,"That new 2019 RDX really is a knock out. But you'll pay a lot at this point for one, unless you're getting the base model. One big advantage of the TLX, as I know I've already said in some detail, is that you can potentially lease one for significantly less than a comparable Accord."
197,No spare in the i3 or 2er; the ti has a spare that has never been used in the 23 years I've owned the car.
198,"oh, we would not be buying one now.  Just deciding if we want to put it on the wish list and plan around it.  I would be quite happy with a much more affordable TLX too."
199,"My worst tire changing experience was on my 2000 F250 diesel, the one I used to pull the 5th wheel travel trailer.  I was cruising down Interstate 10 and the right rear tire just let go.  This was well out in the country, on the approach to the Brazos River bridge, actually.  The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep.   That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack.  I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did.  Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack."
200,"Yeah, stuff like this is why I'm never going to bother with changing a tire ever again."
201,I would prefer not to either.  The AAA guy can do that.  Just have to have the tire on hand to put on!
202,"I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes.  But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words...."
203,Interesting link from KBB that popped up in my online reading this AM. Long-term evaluation notes about their TLX:
204,"I'm not about to argue against what you're saying, basically I agree with you.  But...  what exactly does that say about anyone who buys a used Mercedes or BMW or Audi or  ..."
205,"All but two of my 11 BMWs were purchased used, and only four were CPO cars. I always pay them off within 2-3 years and keep them for 8-10 years at a minimum. So far I have no regrets on any of my purchases- although the E90 328i was not exactly exciting and was offloaded to my son. As a point of comparison my Mazdaspeed 3 needed several repairs under warranty and I eventually needed to replace most of the suspension components, but like my BMWs, the pleasure the car gave me outweighed those issues."
206,interesting.  Even more so in a couple years when they are CPO at half the price
207,"Yeah, I noticed that was conspicuously omitted from the article. These are going to make some great buys, used. I don't think they'll get modded, unlike the STi or Type R."
208,"The Stinger is still too big for my tastes- and all the idiot dealers in my area only stock GT2 cars with AWD, pandering to the nitwits that think RWD is tantamount to a death sentence on anything other than straight and level dry pavement. I did see a Stinger in the wild today; I think it looks worse in person..."
209,"Tried to figure out how much it would be to get an Audi A4 with about the same level of equipment as my TLX Tech. The number I came up with was c.46k for the Audi A4 with leather, navi, upgraded sound system, etc.—about 9k more than the TLX."
210,you do gain some HP in the deal though.   and AWD (assuming you are looking at a Quattro).
211,Audi A4 Ultra Prestige FWD.
212,"Ah,  a FWD.  always seems odd to see one of these at an Audi dealer.  And Audi prices.  Forget the extra HP.  that one is detuned.  But, at least I think they did away with the CVT.  I would get a much cheaper TLX instead."
213,"Everybody keeps saying that, so much so that I am beginning to have doubts.  If everyone wants a clean used 2 year old Stinger, then supply and demand will kick in, and the price will go up.  Way up."
214,"Did you see the fuel economy on that model though?  I can vouch that Audi knows how to do FWD as well as anyone, including Honda."
215,I think the Stinger is too big and it's also too expensive for me. The 2019 Kia Forte is soon ta be out and Kia fans are saying it looks sorta like a baby Kia Stinger. The 2019 Kia Forte 6-speed stick would work out good for the Mrs. and I some day.
216,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car."
217,"I think you hit the nail on the head.  The gadgets and whiz bang bells and whistles keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes.  Lots of things are being compromised to hit price points while adding the latest nanny features."
218,"Just read a comparison of Accord 2.0T sport. $36k?! Sign me up for a Stinger instead, please!"
219,Can you get a V6 Stinger for $36K though?  Maybe with discounts?  Would you really want a 2.0T Stinger?
220,2.0T Sport at $36K? You sure that wasn't a Touring?
221,"That's the fair comparison to the 2.0T Accord, however."
222,For a base cloth model. Stinger starts with leather and can be had for $30k.
223,"That's the fair comparison to the 2.0T Accord, however."
224,"Yes, definitey. Yet I don't think many Accord/Camry shoppers are doing that. I just wonder why. Is it  a badge problem or not knowing it even exists?"
225,"I think to most folks, RWD = bad, FWD = good."
226,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
227,I have a theory that 90% of CUV owners would have no clue if they had FWD instead of AWD. I guarantee my wife wouldn’t.
228,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
229,"well, Toyota does stuff like that with a Camry."
230,"But how many people do you think even know that? I'd be willing to bet if you asked 100 random shmoes, maybe one of them would know it is RWD."
231,Found it!
232,"so close to $400 including tax, putting down the DMV fees.  Not a screaming bargain."
233,"0-60 in 5 seconds flat, not too shabby.  Not super car level, but far from slow."
234,"That is a RWD base model, not a GT"
235,The only one that interests me is the RWD GT2; there aren't any in my neck of the woods. I'd still probably end up with a Giulia Ti instead if I was straying from the Munich fold.
236,"This thread seems quiet lately, but finally I'm now an actual member in good standing."
237,"Moving from an Accord to a TLX prevents one tiny problem (which is pretty meaningless)—""meeting"" your exact car at an intersection or on the road. My wife and I made a joke of it, but several times we'd see a white Accord that looked just like mine, or a red Accord that looked just lke hers. Once I was at a four-way stop sign and there were four Accords of different colors and generations there all at once. Now that I'm an Acura owner I do notice Acuras more, but usually they're RDXs, MDXs, and earlier Acura sedans. There are definitely TLXs on the road, but seeing one is pretty rare."
238,"The entire category is slumping. Only Audi is up.  At least the S60 is being replaced this year, giving that tiny number some justification."
239,If I was about 25 pounds lighter and 3 inches shorter  I'd buy  the Audi A/S4.  I really like them.   I don't see any TLX's here in SC or NYC area . What I have noticed was a lot of Q50's ( good leases ) and MDX's in NY the last year or so.
240,benjaminh
241,The S60 and 3 Series are new for 2019. and I think Volvo has a hit on its hand with the new S60/V60.
242,I liked what I saw and read about on it. Hope it is as nice in person.
243,"Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho."
244,Sounds like a nice upgrade to a Accord.  Next time I'm at Acura dealer I will test drive one. Acura's sound system is one of the best systems. Lots of luck with your new ride!
245,"I have never been in an Acura dealership.  I've never driven one, and offhand I can't recall ever riding in one.  I know a couple of people who own one of their SUVs, but I've never happened to ride with them."
246,I'm liking the XC40 more and more as I see the commercials and them in the wild. Saw one today that was in a kind if orangey-red. Really sharp.
247,There is a lot of room in them
248,"I liked the one that I saw at the car show.  One of these days I will find an excuse to be out running errands near the Volvo dealer, and just stop in to browse."
249,"If you want rare, get an RLX!  I saw one out in the wild today, probably the first of 2018!"
250,"Just curious, do you remember if the A5 was FWD or quattro?  The other thing that wouldn't surprise me is if they put low octane fuel in a high octane competitor."
251,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here."
252,"It was Quartto, no sport package, it handled very poorly."
253,"It seems counter intuitive, but it seems that some of the premium/luxury brands are still more problematic than mainstream, cheaper ones.  To me, if I am paying top dollar, one of the things I expect is a well designed and built car, that should need nothing but routine maintenance.  Just like my Hyundais have been!  I would rather not even care how the service department experience is, since I only go once a year and it takes an hour or less."
254,"The top makes for reliability are perennially, Honda and Toyota."
255,But I assume that means Honda/Acura and Toyota/Lexus....?
256,How reliable has your son's Audi been?
257,The S4 8 years ago achieved 4.9.  So there's that.
258,"That's not what they are built for--the expensive cars are generally leased or traded in after a few years, and certainly during warranty.  They are made for people who want the latest in luxury and gadgetry, and a few years, want the NEW latest in luxury and gadgetry."
259,no issues.  I don't think it has been back to the dealer for other than routine service.  And a couple of busted tires!
260,"Kia has changed up the calculus of their lease programs - high MF, low residual but high lease cash."
261,Is lease cash depended on location?
262,I think the Alfa situation is also a bit different; it's a classic European brand that I think can do well if they iron out the QC issues and reliability is decent.
263,"Or folks who have had one or more of those brands, isn't a badge snob, and is looking for better reliability. And before folks jump up and down on me, I'm not saying it will prove more reliable, just talking perceptions and biases here."
264,"For the Stinger, the numbers are national."
265,I'm not aware that Alfa has had major quality issues with its cars lately.
266,So why is it 4800 to 7200?
267,Depending on trim and drive
268,"A lot more Stinger lease info can be found, here:"
269,This thread has been dead for a while.  Did anyone ever actually buy a Stinger?  Inquiring minds want to know.
270,I think I saw one out on the road so far. Maybe.
271,I'd consider a RWD GT2 once depreciation has knocked the price down to a reasonable level. For what one would cost new I'd rather have a CPO F80 M3 or F82 M4- or a Mustang Bullitt for that matter.
272,"The Kia is fast and relatively large..    If you value size in a vehicle, that's great.   But, I'd take the Alfa over it, in that price range."
273,Me too. I do like the Giulia TI as well as the Stelvio TI.
274,"I wouldn't buy a Stinger, for the same reason as the Alfa.    The"
275,"As I said, a RWD GT2 may well be a screaming bargain after the massive depreciation hit."
276,It seems like auto journos were the main group that were in love with the Stinger. And they don't buy them.
277,"This Jalopnik article has an interesting angle on the ""Kia problem""."
278,"This article is describing exactly what I think will be largest problems for Stingers and any other model over 40 grand.  It's not even about the technology, as luxury dealers are sometimes behind on that, too (they were last ones to have their inventory posted online), but the attitude of ""you must buy it today"" that simply doesn't work for people who know they can afford a car twice as expensive, if they wanted to.  All I need is to see the commercials of Kia dealers from my area and I know I don't want to go there.  If they keep the Stinger around I still may need to bite the bullet and go to check it out for my next car.  I get cold sweat even thinking about it."
279,"Kia had a ""Stinger Experience"" here in Phoenix 2 months back and Rick and I went. It was very interesting they had 3 Kia Stinger GT RWD and 3 with AWD. They also had a BMW 640i GC, Audi A5, Porsche Panamera and another car I can't remember. You drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a GT to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""Professional"" drivers. I got the Audi A5 and it was a dog, Rick got the 640 and loved it."
280,"Then don't buy a Kia, but a Genesis G70 with a manual."
281,Does it have a hatch?
282,nope.  Small 4 door sedan.  Bummer.
283,"I knew that.  It was rethorical.  I said here that Stinger belonged to Genesis line IMHO, not Kia."
284,Lease offer on GT 36 months. Tempting.
285,"^^^ There are a great many cars out there which have the 2 letters ""GT"" as part of their nomenclature.  Which one exactly are you referring to here???"
286,Stinger GT in NJ
287,"Wonder what the rest of the details are, such as MF and residual."
288,$299/month  2.0 RWD
289,should be the GT version though to get the hatch.  Or was that what you meant?
290,"I just priced out a Ford F-150 Platinum, heavy on options, and I'm already up to $72,900.  Sure does have everything, though."
291,"Nope I built a 330i sedan.  I looked at what the article compared, I think that is the only fair way to go about it, some people on Bimmerfest think the Stinger should be compared to the 5 series because it's close in wheelbase. But if Kia talks about the 3 series then compare it to the 3 series."
292,"I also, as I have stated before, think the Stinger is closer to the 5-series. No idea why Kia says anything about the 3'er, unless it is only because that is the standard all the mags use."
293,Why do you think it needs to go against a 5 series? Size?  I think Kia wants the 3 series because of the price.
294,"Not sure where we made the comparison before, but yes, because of its size. Comparing on price does not make sense to me. You can get an Escalade and 911 for the same price, so does that mean they are comparable?"
295,"the comparison tests have all been versus the 3, A5, etc.  even if the WB is a little longer, it doesn't really compete against the cars in the E/5 series class.   Seems like it has always been that way though."
296,"They still make the 3GT, the issue really is, the 3GT only comes in xDrive while the Stinger can be had in RWD and AWD. Which I don't think is a proper comparison."
297,"well, in the north east, the 3 series effectively only comes as Xdrive.  You will never find a RWD on the lot.  I am guessing that Kia will likely be the same."
298,"Here is what I posted on the previous page. In terms of interior room, especially rear seat space, the 5 and the Stinger are a virtual tie. In all measurements, it is clear that it is closer to the 5 than the 3."
299,"This because the dealer won't order them, but you can get RWD cars you just have to order them."
300,"The idea of going against 3 rather than 5 is to advertise „it’s bigger, has more power, more stuff and it’s cheaper”.  Going against bigger 5 series that has many more available features (even if optional) would make it rather unsubstantiated in eyes of people who are silling to spend north if 60 grand, even uf couple metrics match.  Just like the CTS might have been 5er size, it was crossed shopped by 3-series buyers, no matter what Cadillac’s marketng department tried to sell."
301,"That may be true where you live, not so much here.  So all you need is to get on a plane, or order."
302,"On the other hand, it could be judged heavier and less dynamic than the 3'er yet hold its own or be better than the 5'er in those areas. Also, of course, WAY cheaper than a comparable 5."
303,I think less than 5 percent of buyers look at curb weight and less tham fifth of those would make it a decision issue.
304,"Yes, but I think many sports sedan buyers ""feel"" the weight."
305,"With current engines, weight is much less an issue than it was 20 or even 10 years ago."
306,BMW certainly keeps porking up.   only so much you can do to overcome physics.
307,"so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?"
308,"Tires and brake pads will complain about weight by making you run out of them sooner and faster.  The tires on my lighter TTS are holding up well, though I am planning to get new PS4's soon."
309,"My 2er weighs about the same as my 1988 M6, which was about 1.5 feet longer. The M6 had a Dinan chip and no cat so it was fairly quick for its day, but certainly not as fast as the 2 Series. That said, the M6 had timeless style and a incredibly cool exhaust note."
310,"Oh, my do we have a new entry into the ELLPS?"
311,Like the idea.  Nice styling.  Dash looks hideous.
312,Looks like one of those Dyson vacuum cleaners. That's not a luxury look--that's GEE-GAW.
313,"I like the dash, it's different, and I'm sure that is what will be coming in the future."
314,"based on my brief drive of the Stinger GT2, Kia will have to up its game to play with the  Audi /BMW / MB crowd; and having a $3500  regional markup is a non-starter"
315,Soooo .... here's a thought.
316,"The lease penetration is pretty high at those price points.    And, the Stinger lease program sucks."
317,"Yes, I think newbies are the focus. And current hyunkia owners that want to get fancier.  And of course people that can’t afford the name brands.  Not seeing a lot of diehards or brand snobs making the switch."
318,"I know the Residual is like 50% and the MF isn't that good, but doesn't Kia have 6700 lease cash? Alfa had the same issue with the Gulita when it first came out, but they lease programs have gotten better."
319,"Having a bit of trouble with passenger volumes of the BMWs, but here is what I was able to dig up. Interestingly, the 3'er has more front leg room than the 5'er. Stinger trumps both. Rear leg room is within a tenth of an inch between the 5'er and Stinger."
320,"They are all a bit too big and heavy for my tastes, although I did enjoy a 440i GC M Sport we had in our loaner fleet. RWD and the M Performance Power and Sound kit made it a lot of fun despite being a bit porky..."
321,"I've heard too many happy BMW owners over too many years and too many car models praise the in-line 6 engines, that to get a BMW without one would be sacrilegious to me."
322,"I was one, yet I have a four-cylinder now and think it's quite alright."
323,"The BMW is a car, not a church (although some might contest that)"
324,"Ditto..     Of course, the last n/a 6 cylinder helped push me that way.  It was uninspiring."
325,"The N/A straight six had a great sound.  Beautiful, I loved it.  But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s.  My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability.  Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers.  Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far.  We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six.  Those four cylinders are still building the record.  One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines.  Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."
326,"Dino the N20/26 engine had a timing chain issue that BMW has FINALLY recognized and have increased the factory warranty, other than that the N series engine seems to be pretty built proof. The new B series engines are too new but would think they are just as built proof. The mileage for the F3X series cars have exceeded the EPA #, on a trip to Santa Fe, I averaged 37, Rick got 36 going to Austin in his GT."
327,"Comparison test of an Audi A4, BMW 430 GC xDrive and Kia Stinger AWD"
328,Ha! I was just going to post that.  Kia takes on the big boys. The Stinger isn't perfect but look at the price differential!
329,I read that article in the magazine.  Seems like BMW took the hit there.  Audi romped.
330,"They really did like the A5 Sportback.  What amazes me, is the A4 is significantly lighter than the A5 Sportback, and is essentially the same car.   The sportback might be tuned a bit more aggressively suspension-wise though than the ""family"" sedan."
331,"I posted this over on Bimmerfest and of course, many people are bitching that the 430i xDrive didn't have the ""right"" suspension. Of course, not too sure what they mean by that since you can't get xDrive with the 704 suspensions. But the price is a whopping 14K difference, is Audi worth it?"
332,"Based on Car & Driver's review and my bias, I'd say so."
333,"Not sure if 430ix standard suspension is same as my one in my RWD 430i (I have a std., not M-sport, not adaptive M-sport).  Anyway, I don't care what C&D says about 430 ix GC steering and suspension.  It's good enough for me.  Perhaps I'm getting older.  On my next round of vehicles I may be out of ELLPS altogether and into stupid SUVs.  Ugh.  Or maybe one more - if so, both A5 SB and Stinger will be on the list."
334,"I'm with you, my 330 suspension is base, but it has the right amount of firmness without being harsh. I like Stinger, I don't care if it doesn't have the best suspension I have no plans on tracking my cars again. But a 14K difference is a huge difference."
335,"MB been doing that now for 15  yrs with the CLS, it's an E class with a sleek body and they charge more for it."
336,kia stinger gt AWD-- this it top of line v6
337,"Now it's about the dealer - if I have to put up with some sleazball salesman who is used to selling stuff to people with 550 FICO and won't change his tune, I may be deterred by him.  Unfortunately my recent experiences at establishments selling ""mainstream"" cars have not been overly positive. To be blunt, every time I went to a place like that, I felt like needing a long hot shower.  Hopefully I'll get lucky next time."
338,"That's my worry as well, not to mention potential warranty hassles if I took a Stinger to an HPDE. At least you can get it in RWD. Having said all that, my usual strategy of buying a 2-3 year old CPO works great for me, the only downside being the ability to tailor a car to my exact specs- for example if I had ordered my F22 it would have had a red interior, PDC, and no hole in the roof- but the $15,000 savings compensates for the ""imperfections."""
339,"I had wondered the same thing when Nissan started selling the GT-R here. Here is a dealership whose average sales price is about $25K, now sell a 90K car. If you don't want a KIA, then get a Genesis G70 with a manual. But I don't have a problem walking into Kia dealership to get my car serviced, and if it does have to get service I'm not too worried. I highly doubt they will screw things up, yeah, I won't get the free loaner have a nice lounge to sit in, but I saved 14K..."
340,"In a world of $60k pick-em-up trucks, I don't see how folks can be so snobbish about a $50k car, frankly."
341,"Maybe Kia could cash in on the ""reverse status"" thing----""EVERYONE has a BMW and Audi, but I have no need for such ostentatious displays"".   Tricky to pull that off, but it has been done."
342,was that how much you spent on your truck?
343,Mine had a sticker dangerously close to $50k and I don't even have leather!
344,"LOL, and people complain that a base 320i doesn't have power seats."
345,"Yes, but in order to really save 14K you'd have to have a car with similar specs and performance, now, you could argue your getting somewhere around 9/10th's for 8/10th's cost.  As with everything, there is a law of diminishing returns."
346,"After buying the S4, I didn't feel so bad about spending so much money once I saw how much people were spending on average trucks and SUV's."
347,"So I went and built a Stinger 2.0 RWD and a BMW 330i, I believe they are as close as you can get, and there is a 7K difference.  Now if you pick 4 series then it's close to 9K difference. When Genesis brings the G70 you will be able to get it with a 6 spd manual and the difference wont be that great but I'm sure the BMW will be more."
348,I would add the upcoming new smaller genesis (3 series competitor).
349,"But the question is, what is Entry Level? As I wrote, my 330i MSRP was 47K, and does not have leather? What list of options or standard equipment makes it an Entry Level? If you added leather to my car the MSRP would have been close to 49K.  Just because it has BMW badge makes it ELLPS?"
350,"It's a marketing term, it's not something quantifiable."
351,Volvo?  Aren't they kind of like Buick? (snicker snicker).
352,I fully get it so why can't other brands be brought into conversations?
353,Spartan can mean different things to different people.
354,Luxury..   We decided it meant a luxury brand.
355,Well it's a consensus kind of thing. One has to set a limit somewhere--or as the old saying goes:
356,Then there is the 'near ellps' 2018 Kia Stinger. Nice car but no brand image as far as luxury goes.
357,"yup.  Sometimes you get the car without the badge.  and sometimes you get the badge, without the car!  Up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them.  The drive or the prestige (posing)"
358,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category.  To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate.  It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many."
359,"the stinger really does seem like the acid test here.  Car looks to have everything required to be a playa' if (and around here too, a big if!) they can overcome the dealer experience."
360,Dino do tell about your 430 GC!!
361,"My non-negotiables are RWD, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, I'd at least"
362,"Before I bought my M235i I also considered a Camaro SS 1LE, a Challenger SRT8, a 2013 Boss 302, a 2016 Mustang GT Premium w/Performance Package, a Lotus Elise, a 370Z NISMO, a Cayman S, and a WRX STI, so I didn't confine myself to the ELLPS market segment."
363,"I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review.  They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH.  Top speed of 167.  If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA."
364,To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just
365,"Have to remember, as far as I know, the Stinger's class is midsized. Yet magazines always seem fixated on comparing everything to the compact 3-series instead."
366,That is because Kia used the 3 series and its benchmark.
367,"RR mentioned the Giulia TI, which won Car of the Year. I loved the one I drove, but Alfa needed to rethink their leases, for a 45K car they wanted 3K down, and payments of $550/m But today you can get that same car for min down and 420/m which is in line with BMW."
368,"As does (did)  every other automaker. BMW practically invented ""sport sedan"", even before they got that posh image."
369,"Depending where you look, you might find different numbers.  I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS.  Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."
370,"The car is great so far.  I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich.  Then  picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa.  Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect.  Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent.  Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market.  The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed.  It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328.  No longer Buick like.  I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3.  The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything."
371,3 series in no longer compact.  It grew in both size and weight.  It is a legitimate midsize today.
372,"Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190. So definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."
373,"I looked at a white StingerGT2 2 weeks ago. I sat it in and it had far more room than my Q50S. I mentioned that it looked like a 5'er interior to the sales person. The exterior is far more upscale that is more up to date than a 3'er, IMHO."
374,"So the Stinger looks like a  legitimate effort from Kia.  Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market.  If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives.  Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too.  One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo.  It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech.  It may be a positive for some."
375,These are full lengths.  More important would be wheel base and cabin space/legroom. Does anybody have those handy?
376,Sounds like the 2 liter might be the better bang for the buck.
377,What fires?
378,My son received his for his E90  328i.
379,Interesting the article doesn't say much about what years are affected.
380,"The second recall involves the heated PCV valve. I talked with several techs at work and a couple of them said that they had seen blower motors with connectors that had gotten hot, but none of them looked like they were anywhere close to catching fire. No one had seen the PCV issue."
381,"If you are the one affected, then the casualty rate is 100%"
382,I've looked at a few different chats(blogs) here at edmunds and have been very impressed by the responses (certainly in the lease/deal sections) from the moderators. Nice work.
383,Thanks! Appreciate the shout out.
384,"Boy, this forum has died."
385,"I know what will revive this discussion.  Let's argue about what constitutes the right amount of luxury and performance to be a vehicle that fits ""Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedan."""
386,Only $200? At the dealer? That's a bargain.
387,The Dinatronics Sport for my car is only $300.
388,"These mods. sound nice, but do they they invalidate the warranty?"
389,They can; a lot depends on the dealer and the amount of the warranty claim.
390,"considering it is just a software update, it really should not be all that expensive.  Well, it could be if the value is there, but not like there is much labor or parts involved."
391,"Tuners claim the cost is to reimburse them for R&D, since it is just software."
392,"oh sure, just like Microsoft, etc."
393,The Dinantronic tunes are piggybacks.
394,"If the dealer offers it, they back it up"
395,Not at the dealer many aftermarket companies
396,"This is true, however, I'm not worried as I don't abuse the engine enough be concerned."
397,Doesn't the dealer offer a tune? Or did they stop that?
398,BNW does not offer one for the 4 cyl in the US only the 6.
399,I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune.  The S4's is the most expensive.
400,For a while years back Audi let Stasis get in bed with them.
401,"As prices continue to climb what is really an ELLP?  If you are talking about the base model, mid-level model?"
402,I think it's a combination of badge + price more than the individual options list---although we do expect an ELLP not to be spartan in any way.
403,I'm pretty sure that
404,"I am also wondering about Fiat. They were WAY down at the tail end before, so I'm pretty sure there is still one worse than Caddy."
405,I guess there isn't enough data for Alfa Romeo yet?
406,"Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system).  BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars."
407,Acura is probably entirely related to the 9 speed AT
408,Nor with BMW or Toyota. I guess my 2 flawless Cadillacs don't count either.
409,"Well, in a survey, any individual response really doesn't mean much."
410,"dino....seems that way, doesn't it."
411,"quite likely.  there is also some time lag to those surveys, so what you buy today may be different than what got dinged."
412,"I wouldn't give Audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. I think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control UNDER control."
413,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus."
414,"Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue).  For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%.  I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have)."
415,"They count, but you've only had the 2nd one for how long?"
416,"You didn't own the Infiniti long enough, but it seems the Asian brands are your anti/counter-magnet to getting bad cars as"
417,"Does mean it drives better or sportier than a 330i, but to each their own"
418,"""Show us where the bad Neon touched you, Andres. That's the only way we can help you get past this incident that still affects you so deeply even though it happened 20 years ago."""
419,Good point!
420,"Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus."
421,Hard to see the point given that you seem prone to simply dismiss any such reports that do not fit your narrative.
422,I picked up the latest issue of
423,I have seen that comparison a number of times now and the verdict is almost never the same. Although I do believe the RS5 always finishes last.
424,"depends a lot on priorities, as with every comparison test."
425,"When was younger I would live, breath and sleep these comparison test, I could quote stats all day long. But as I got older and owned some of these cars I realized that numbers really don't mean much, since testing is never done at the same time of year, or track or weather condition. So for the average Joe any one of these cars would be OK with and no see any of the ""issues"" the writers saw.  I wouldn't mind having any of those cars and I know I would happy owning it.  Now, I wish BMW would build a M4 GC..."
426,I've been reading comparison tests since 1967; I find the magazines that most closely mirror my preferences are
427,"I've been a fan of Peter Egan for years, because of writing also motor Motorcyclist. I was very lucky to spend 5 days with him back in the early 90's on a motorcycle ""festival"" called The Three Flags, very fascinating person.  All of those cars you posted will exceed the posted speed limit many times over, handles MUCH better then most people will push and for those reasons doesn't matter what car people will buy, Most if not all will never push those cars to their respected limits. That is why I think those articles are boring, What I think would be interesting is these magazines would take a BMW 320 and put against say a Kia Optima and see if the added cost for the BMW is worth it. Or take a 330i v Altima, Accord, Camry, Sonata, Optima and see if the additional cost of the BMW is worth the price. Since it seems that many people troll this board for that topic."
428,"I'd find badge engineering comparos interesting.   Pit an X1 against the Mini equivalent, a GTI against the A3, the Smart Car against the......  well, never mind."
429,How is it that my 12 yo Acura TL looked good and was highly reliable. And yet the new TLX IMHO doesn't look as good and Acura's reliablity is in the dumper according to CR. Not a lot of progress in 12 years.
430,"""Guess who's back, back again, shadys back, tell a friend"""
431,"I've been a fan of Peter Egan for years, because of writing also motor Motorcyclist.

432,"The the comment above - I hope the BMW wins. BMW has been leasing ""el cheapo"" cars for years and calling them the ultimate driving machines. (Talking 320 for those new here) Would be great to see if they can beat a Ultima (Nissan).  For 299 a month I think the BMW should win - at msrp I would think it could be tougher-"
433,Anyone get the recall regarding parts implicated in BMW fires?
434,Why not wonder if a Kia Rio handles just as good as a 330i.
435,"Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic."
436,That does it- the 2er and 3er are going on Craigslist and I'm headed to the Kia Store!!!
437,Agree .. my neighbor's  kid has the mazda6  which  has 19's. I'm not a mazda6 fan but the handling on this Mazda is excellent
438,I had a Mazdaspeed 3 and I really liked it. My wife may well end up getting a CX-3 in a year or two. Mazda is my favorite of all the Asian brands; I actually put off replacing my Mazdaspeed3 for a year in hopes that the rumored 300hp AWD Mazdaspeed3 was coming to market. No such luck...
439,In the right hands......
440,"Bingo, shifty!"
441,Yet I get the feeling we've strayed a bit off topic this last day or two.
442,"Not any longer!  Though my looking supported a theory of mine. This class is hurting, because the competition from below is fierce.  Mainstream cars, for much less money, that are so good already that the extra money is hard to justify for many people.   Especially in the smaller models."
443,"Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay."
444,"That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving...  Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste.  Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries.  Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats?  I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life!  I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm."
445,"well, my pending Elantra sport is an interesting example, compared to my son's A3.  Not as many gizmos (his is loaded).  But similar size, comparable performance (short of Quattro), many same features.  similar ride and handling.  Less prestigious badge.  But for most people, not a huge difference.  Other than price, which was a full $20,000 cheaper."
446,"Interesting - forgot about the A3 in your family. A longer term comparison will be interesting. Gotta have your son drive the Hyundai and offer his opinion. Better yet, let him take it to NY and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer)."
447,If you want a RWD sport sedan the mainstream brands really don't offer any competition- although the Genesis G80/G90 and the KIA Stinger are notable exceptions. If you don't care which wheels are driven and simply want a wide assortment of gadgets then a bread and butter sedan may well be the way to go.
448,But is it really comparable?
449,I think the point is you can get 80% (or more) of the performance and features for 50% of the price.
450,"yes, pretty much.  The incremental improvement costs a whole lotta money."
451,"Well that's the whole marketing scheme isn't it? To dangle a few extra baubles in front of the consumer so that he upgrades?  I mean, isn't advertising about making you dissatisfied with what you already own?  Certainly, that seems to drive the leasing of ELLPS, at any rate."
452,Wow.....this old thread is back.  Got really contentious in here for a while so I ignored it.  Good to see it in friendlier confines.
453,A car with that MSRP came with a battery tender?  LOL!
454,"Interesting, now I came from a base suspension 320, to a base suspension 330i and the two are worlds difference. The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before.  Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"
455,"LOL ah, the good old day when ELLPS were cheap... The price of your 1998 A4 is the same cost of a middle-level Nissan Altma..  Have fun with one of those."
456,"That's true in most markets, not just cars."
457,"For reliability, according to Consumer Reports, Lexus is at the top and Cadillac is at the bottom...."
458,"I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking.  Especially Audi.  Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there.  Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting."
459,Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's.   Where have you been?
460,Kind of amazing how Honda has slipped. And Acura much more so.
461,So his experience with Audi didn't count?
462,"I had the BMS stage 1 on my 320 and never had an issue, I'm not worrying about the JB4."
463,"I rolled some negative cash from the 320 into this new car, the value of the 320 was falling, and wasn't going to get better."
464,"Question is if it will void your warranty. And the answer is yes. At least as far as damage that may be related to it, such as the entire drivetrain."
465,The trick is finding a dealership and service advisers that ignore a TD1 flagging.
466,"Mine was good about it and helped me get things fixed but he did say if the engine blows, for example, there isn't much they can do because corporate will inspect the computer and find out."
467,"There is always a change but my 320 and Ricks 328 hasn't had an issue, I don't plan on pushing more than the tune."
468,Boy did this forum die....
469,Along with the sedan...
470,"In the interest of reviving this thread, I pose a hypothetical."
471,Q50
472,"Drive them all and buy what YOU like. I want a RWD, car, so that biases my choices"
473,C class is really really nice.
474,"Yeah, I've been admiring them lately."
475,"You pretty much can’t go wrong with all of the above.  The only thing I have against a 3-Series is that they haven’t changed much, and the interior has remained essentially the same through the years.  Still wouldn’t throw it out of bed for eating crackers.  It’s all personal choice."
476,"Your statement is completely wrong, The 3 series has changed where it was needed, with the new B46 engine I feel it is a lot more fun to drive as the torque is lower in the rev band. The small changes to the interior and iDrive software has been an improvement."
477,"I just bought 2018 430i Gran Coupe.  Keen eye would see subtle difference with the 330 sedan, but from a distance they both look similar.  BMW has made a decent progress in addressing my largest complaint, i.e. steering wheel and suspension feel.  It's not quite as heavy as my previous 2018 328, but it got to the area where it's no longer Buick.  The interior is improved, the stitched plastic dashboard cover is a nice touch.  One thing that feels really old and tired, are the speedometer and odometer.  Almost the same as they were 10 years ago, which were almost the same as those 10 years prior that.  I even joke that those BMW designers obsess about their engine, transmission and everything else, then three weeks before launch they suddenly realize that they need a new dashboard, so they stick the old one, again."
478,"When it comes to looks, you can tell BMW is playing it safe, the look is evolution and bold and in your face like what Acura had done to the TL, I think the BMW is a handsome sedan. I'm not 100% sold on the new C class but like the looks of the A4."
479,"Congrats on the 430, so you went with the 8 Spd auto, how you like it? I'm still leaning towards a 440 GC next."
480,"I went with auto, cause there wasn't anything else available with GC.  When I was preparing to change from my wagon, I made peace with AT as my next transmissions already some time ago.  I decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission.  The transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless.  It isn't manual, but it will do."
481,"Aside from a 3 year stint with the Fusion I've had a manual for the better part of the last 15 years, granted not as long as some here but long enough that was very accustomed to the enjoyment of rowing my own gears.  I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day.  Like"
482,"I've come to the point where I prefer manuals in cars that really need one- those with engines that need to be wound out to make significant power, like my Club Sport. With engines that make peak torque from 1300-4500 rpm-such as the N55 and B58-I prefer theZF 8HP; it shifts quickly, rev matches, and has a true manual mode."
483,"That's my feeling. If you don't need to work the stick, then don't buy the stick."
484,"Michaell, since shopping is free and fun, and you never know which dealer will have free food!, why not visit your local Jag dealer too, and check out the XE?  Good driving from what I've read, interior may not be up to snuff (more performance than lux).  But, only you can decide what floats your boat."
485,That is something that sadly has gone away here in recent years. There was one GM dealer in particular that always had free food on offer. It changed ownership and that is now gone.
486,"we looked at a used Jag XF (2013) Wednesday.  Wife was not impressed by the interior (I found the seats fantastic, her less so, but mostly because is was that odd orange color).  But the part she found oddest was when I finally figured out how to put the AC on, and the vents rotated open and close.  Just seems like a solution to a problem that did not exist, and one more thing to break (expensively)."
487,"I don't have any experience with BMW's DCT's.  I heard the early ones a long time ago were lackluster to put it nicely, but I thought they had made vast improvements?  What would be your ""complaint"" list on the current crop of the latest and greatest DCT's from BMW?"
488,"They are okay onde you are on the move, but they are a bit laggy at low speeds and when shifting from forward to reverse."
489,Mazda6 handling vs  BMW 330 . Does Mazda6 have a leg to stand on?? Love to see the 6 in a manual? I thought the 17 Mazda's handling was superb
490,I'd imagine if the Mazda 6 was given an upgraded wheel/tire size it would hang as long as horsepower was previously agreed to not be used.
491,$5500
492,"Driven the TLX a couple of times (V6).  If those incentives were going on when I was looking, my choice might have been different (ended up with a Q50 3.0T, which I like quite a bit)."
493,"I drove a 2015, with about 30k on it. Trans seemed fine.  The 2018s hit in June I think per salesguy. If I was buying now, would jump on a 4 cyl tech with all the incentives.  Maybe the 18s are worth waiting for, but who knows what the deals will be like at year end."
494,"Agreed.  That said, dealers are going to try to hold to MSRP on the '18s for as long as they can.  I might look at them this time next year.  But, for right now, a $45K '17 TLX SH-AWD ADVANCE would probably be in the realm of $35-$36K.  The 4 cyl would probably be close, or maybe even below $30K.  Both would be a screaming deal on a fun, reliable car."
495,Don't say it's so
496,You'll be fine.  The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made.  Find a good indy shop for the services.  My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service.  I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.
497,Andres3 - yes no issues yet and I enjoy it a great deal. Was told I need new summer tires soon which will be expensive.
498,"Acura got out of the sporty/hot car deal a while ago.  And they do have a Civic and CRV (ILX and RDX).  They are both just ready to be replaced.  For the last models, they followed about 6-12 months after the Honda doner car was redesigned."
499,Already did......
500,"I had my eye on the TLX all along.  Though I did kinda forget about it there for a while, but now back on the list.  At least the wife likes it a lot too, which of course will make my life more pleasant!"
501,Seems acura got out of the sedan/car biz for what seems 10 years ... Maybe more. They used to compete vs Lexus. Now it seems Buick.
502,If I was in the market now the TLX with technology 4 or V6 would be high on my list.  I have been very pleased with Honda products.
503,I think even Honda fans will Admit that there's a reason Acura can't get much more than 90% of MSRP on their sedans the last decade or so though.  Combination of overpriced and under-delivering in my opinion.
504,"While I agree Acura has become Buick - don't get me going on them- Infiniti has become even more irrelevant. While Acura has the MDX, Infiniti has zero products that are upper third (half) of any category in Luxury market. They used to have the g sedan and coupe (something Acura and Lexus forgot about) that actually sold and could compare to BMW 3."
505,"Yeah, it doesn't compare. it has surpassed the 3."
506,If you are talking Mazda 3 I agree. Infiniti doesn't want it's used cars back. (I would guess BMW is similar)
507,At my dealer we take in a
508,"When I bought my 2005 Acura TL in late 2004, Acura was on a roll with the best looking car (IMHO, still love that styling) and Infiniti had the G35 which was also a looker and doing well. Fast forward 12 years and Acura has lost it, and so seems has Infiniti, at least in the sporty sedan arena. Audi is resurgent and BMW is treading water/surviving on it's long standing reputation. And I think cars in general are less of an interest than then, with Tesla/electrics, hybrids, Uber, Lyft all competing for transportation, along with gadgets and the internet for people's cash."
509,Local Acura dealers are discounting the TLX 4 cyl with tech 7K. Not too sure if a TLX is a good idea unless you are shopping strictly on price.
510,I really like the TLX.  Just fits me well.
511,TL TLX amazed how Acura got it wrong... Here is the new TLX
512,"Went and drove a 4 cyl with Tech and 6 cyl W/ tech and was disappointed. I think Acura is the new Infiniti in which they lost their Mojo. It's sad to see this, it's even sadder that Infiniti has to use German Engines and Transmissions to get the powertrain right...  It's even sadder that they are discounting the TLX do much to move them off the lots."
513,"I have not driven a 4 cyl yet, but really liked the 6 cyl I tried.  But that is why they make so many different cars.  something for (almost) everyone!"
514,"The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it. The only difference between a 4 and 6cyl Tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features Honda/Acura does not."
515,Infiniti and Acura are lost for sure... Lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) IS.... They also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. Infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (pathfinder q)  that I guess is the reason Nissan gives them a lifeline. Acura has one real product the MDX. Yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. The old nsx had the integra r and gsr (had one) to point to.
516,"I agree Acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for Honda/Acura to give up on an engine so quickly."
517,I'm thinking Acura will be dropping a turbo 4 into the TLX within the next 2 yrs. Honda will have a Turbo 4 in the Accord next year.
518,"Out with the old and in with the new. It was time to get a new car, my first choice was the Alfa loved how it drove, and for the price hard to beat, but when it came to lease payments, yicks...  Basically told the dealer when they were serious about selling the car to call me."
519,"Warning: the BMS will void your warranty. Unless the dealers have started offering it, which would shock me."
520,sounds like the car I would look at later in the year (the service loaner lease part).  What did the before tax payment end up being on that?
521,"XC60 is still only one line.  That's the thing - most dealers didn't even stock R-line trims, so one wouldn't know about their existence without more extensive research.  The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following.  Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes."
522,"I've heard of and looked at them briefly.  I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4.  Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor.  It just doesn't win on any specification.  And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago).  Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255.  My wife's Sportwagen has 225.  That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle."
523,Not much talk in the last 2 months..
524,We just got our first two G30s- a 540i xDrive M Sport and a 530i xDrive Sport Line(shown below). I've driven the 530i and I like it MUCH better than any F10 I have driven. The car feels a lot faster than I expected. It's still a bit too big for my tastes but it's really an impressive drive.
525,Why were you doing head/handstands when you took those pics?
526,Now those are some sticky tires!
527,"That's a very nice good-looking blue on the BMW 5-Series.  If Kia's blue on the Optima was more like that and less Purple/Violet, I'd have selected it!"
528,"Are those the ""new"" 5-series introduced at NAIAS earlier this month?"
529,That is them.
530,"How can the E codes be good for BMW for 40 years, but it only took 10 years to blow through the F codes, and now it's G?"
531,"While I'm sure the drive is much better, I hope the interior is more revolutionary than evolutionary in change than the exterior."
532,Because now every permutation gets a new number. The E36 code covered
533,"That's SOP for Munich, every extensive redesign is followed by a more conservative replacement. See: E12, E28, E34, E39, E60, F10. The G30 is the low key model transformation."
534,"Audi Club guys like to refer to their A4's and S4's as B5 or B6, or B7, or B8, or now B9 A4's and S4's."
535,"Year ranges are fine, but can be tricky, when certain model variations carry longer than others.  Example:  2012 328 sedan was F30, but all other bodies were still E9x, like my wagon.  IIRC 3-series convertible carried all through 2013, before being replaced by 2014 F3x 4-series."
536,They should handle it like software versions. You could be driving an E36.2.2!
537,"I personally love Mercedes C-Class. Besides its prestigious status, this sedan is spacious and very easy to drive."
538,We sat in one at the car show. It was a nice impressive package.  My wife loved it a lot.
539,"If you recently sold or traded in a BMW for a Mercedes, Jaguar, Volvo, Audi or Cadillac vehicle, a reporter would be interested in speaking with you about your experience. Please send a note to PR@Edmunds.com no later than 5 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. Thanks!"
540,I'm back..... Noticed this forum still going which is nice to see.. Update 2013 B8.5 s4 now has 35k miles. No problems thus far with just routine maintenance to report along with one quarter panel needed to be replaced after the neighbor backed into it last feb. Just recently had the 35k service done which also included a transmission flush and filter replacement. Funny thing about Audi service they don't advertise Audi care - which you can bundle 2 10k services for 800 bux. Not cheap but considering the 35k service alone I was quoted 900 - and that's just for One service.
541,Dealership service rates have gone mad.
542,Wow haven't been here since February - and well nothing has changed - update 2013 s4 warrantee just expired - so 4 year old Audi 37k miles (remember I bot it 10 months old with 14k). Do I trade it for a CPO? Buy a new one? Or keep it (love it) knowing the service bell will be ringing at some point around 40k?
543,"Two people drive this board, and you're one of them.  Welcome back."
544,"I assume it counts, but last week I test drove a V6 TLX advance.  It was very nice."
545,The deals on the TLX are supposed to be very nice right now. I've heard it's possible to get as much as $7k off of list on the V-6 model.
546,Entry-level luxury sales for April:
547,Should be able to do better than that..   $6250 of incentives on the V-6 model.
548,Has Acura fixed the transmission issues on the TLX V-6 model?
549,Wow. What are the incentives on the 4-cylinder TLX?
550,Tks
551,Will do!
552,I am. He's got a couple of places in Freehold that I have been to. I test drove the RX350 and GLK350 at the Benz and Lexus dealers there within the past couple of weeks. Salesguy at the Lexus dealer was very very good.
553,That's sad.  There is a handsome looking black 750 iL that I saw last week pulling away from a stop light belching blue smoke out the exhaust.  It reminded me of my Vega years ago.
554,Q what years did you test drive  ? which did you like better
555,"Let me guess, an A8, an S8, and an R8?"
556,"Looks like they shuffled the line up inside but yes when you walk in you see these beautiful   A/S8, RS7's, TT, Q7's , SQ5's  scroll down on my pic of the dealership showroom floor. The  line has changed or this is when they 1st opened.  Last I was in there they has a red and silver TT side by side. Sharp and sharper."
557,This one is better  Ray Catena
558,And yes I lost 3yrs off my 2001 start date to. I might of had a different name thou?
559,"No, everyone (I think) got sent back to 2001 with the software switch."
560,Only if it comes with a fine bottle of Scotch
561,"2013 GLK, and I think 2010? Rx350. I was really disappointed in the Lexus. Although the interior was nice, it drove/felt like a much cheaper vehicle. GLK drove great but I just could not get comfortable in it."
562,I found the GLC to be a nice upgrade over the GLK comfort and interior wise.  I would be real happy with one of those.  Not that it will be in my budget for a long time.
563,"GLC is high on my wifes new ride list.  I priced a 2017 w leather, premium pck, Sport pck,, heads up display and upgrade  surround sound.  Pricey at 50k. The Selenite grey which we both like  was a $720  color option."
564,Actually I just looked at my spread sheet the  17 GLC  I priced was invoiced at 51k.
565,"The BMW you owned didn't have the N63 engine, this could be one reason for no issues."
566,But you can't build one on BMW website and the pricing guide has not been released.
567,"When we were looking for Rick next car, we drive a 2015 RX350, and was very disappointed in it, there was no refinement in that thing. There was no sound deadening, the ride was horrible, and the interior screamed Toyota. The NX we drove was far better but was too small."
568,"We went and looked at the new C coupe and while at the dealership looked at the GLC impressed with both, a big upgrade over the GLK. 50K seems to be the price for a well equipped SUV."
569,That's up to BMW NA; I'd think that the information will be released in the very near future- but I'm just guessing.
570,Well I'm just over 5K and I aint seen no stinkin' mug or tee shirt!
571,Contact
572,"I'm looking for accommodations in Manhattan, Aspen, Malibu.... Oh, and San Fran."
573,"I have accommodation in three of those, but I'm not sharing....but there's probably a couch for you in Santa Monica."
574,"Ha, see if I mail you any more Edmunds pens."
575,"I just stumbled on a great ELLPS - Volvo S60/V60 R-Design trim.  305 horses, very nice cabin, all goodies included, around 50 grand sticker.  Just drove one, nice steering feedback, better than first intallment on F3x 3-series (improved by now, but still),  nice suspension.  Drives as well as my 328, it is a bit faster, AWD.  Looks good, too.  Lots of value.  I may be really tempted to save some money versus 440 Grand Coupe, or even 430.  Volvo always has some good incentives, or I could also take Overseas Delivery, which doesn't have them, but you get two ticketsvticket on Premium Economy with SAS (4 grand value, I know for a fact),  full concierge experience in Goetynburgh and hotel stay.  That's more than BMW's ED."
576,It broke already.
577,"We looked at Volvo the XC60, at the time the tickets were only coach, I'm not sold on the supercharge and turbo charged engine. I like the S90 but they need more then a 4 cyl."
578,Here is a deal someone posted on Bimmerfest.
579,"Funny thing; one of our most successful client advisors is an attorney who retired from a large well-respected Louisville law firm. As you might expect, his client base is heavily populated with attorneys. I delivered a 440i convertible to one of his clients who had bought himself the car for a retirement present; he had been a top notch criminal defense attorney and as we walked out to the car he asked, ""Are you as glad to be out of the legal field as much as I am?"""
580,"Was checking out Tesla's last week. What a sharp Car... In the last quarter, Tesla sold 9,156 examples of the Model S.  Mercedes sold  4,921 S-Classes, and the BMW 7 Series came in third with 3,634 units sold. That puts Tesla's share of the segment, which includes 12 different vehicles, at 32 percent. It's by and large the king of this segment, helped by a 59 percent year-over-year improvement.  The Tesla S is a beautiful vehicle very classy and luxurious. Shame its range is useless in my world."
581,and this..
582,All  good facts and  info . Another thing I forgot to mention was Tesla sells on 2 Lux cars.
583,Curious if you know if the Genesis/Cadenza's are made in the USA like the Optima.  Usually manufacturer's make their flagship where quality matters more than lowest bidder.
584,I know Hyundai has a plant in Montgomery but I'm guessing the Genesis is being made in South Korea.  Just a guess thou. I know there were talks to assembly here last year don't know much more .
585,"What's the first letter and/or number on the VIN for your Genesis; that'll tell us the answer, at least in 2013."
586,Its K..............assuming that means Korea???????
587,"Yeah, see, they don't trust us filthy Americans with their best stuff."
588,andres3
589,"I like Harmon other wise known as HK.  Don't think they should drop the Kardon part.   My previous receiver which I still have is an HK.  I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore.  When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK.  Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it."
590,"I highly doubt the 530i will start at 60K, that is almost 10K more than the 2016 528i, and over 5K more then a 2017 E350. Since pricing hasn't been released I'm thinking base price for a 530i will be close to 53-55K. The standard equipment list for the 530i is impressive."
591,Here are some interesting articles.
592,I'd buy the G80 over the G90 (Old Equus model ) Its a better buy for the money.
593,"We had a first Gen Genesee and liked it, and with the improvements of the new gen I can see sales being taken away from Lexus and MB."
594,The G90 reviews on Edmunds  (old Euuis )  are not as good as the G80.
595,"The 550i is nice enough, I just find the F10 too soft for my tastes. I think I'd rather have an M Sport X5 xDrive50i. I still think that the 340i is the sweet spot- for BMW sedans at any rate."
596,"I was under the impression that all Dealers were getting 2 G30's as demo now, I like the concept of the 550i but that engine just has too many issue for me to spend 80K and have it break down like they have."
597,I just confirmed the info with my NCM; our center isn't expected to see a G30 until late January.
598,The 550i with the n63TU engine has known issues stay away from them even though the N63Tu is the updated version of the N63 engine it still has problems. Its a great car but the engine has known issues.
599,When can people start to order the G30?
600,I like the color combo on this X5 / m
601,YOU want info on the N63 engine issues
602,"I can honestly say I  had a good run with  limited problems with my 2 older bought new Bmw  750's ( 95, 2000 )  and now on my 3rd X-5 ( 08,12,16)"
603,I will find out and post it.
604,Wow you really dodged a bullet on the 7 Series....good for you!
605,The G30 5er can be ordered immediately. Our earliest build date is week 51.
606,"I rode in an uber early Thursday morning on my way to the airport.  The car was a black Hyundai Genesis, an older model but I couldn't tell how old but what impressed me was it had 139k miles on it and was smooth and quiet as a new car.  I was impressed with the ride given the amount of miles."
607,I bet if you guys stop  going threw cars like I do underwear you can buy a 60k  vehicle.
608,"Well, can, and would, are not the same thing."
609,"Hey, I resemble that remark!"
610,Here is a short review of the 2017 MB E300.. 70K for this car...
611,Looks like that link is funky....try this one
612,"Not too sure what happened, but here is the link from the current test drive of the online C&D."
613,So what has happened to everybody?
614,"Might sound dumb, but what are MSD'S? Have no clue what these are since we've never leased. Please educate me on these."
615,Multiple security deposits
616,"MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."
617,And the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have?  Or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the MSD bait?
618,"The benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the MSD, then without."
619,"So who does it benefit, is what I'm asking?  Why create a system that makes less profit?"
620,The leasing company gets the use of the MSD funds for the duration of the lease. Add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right.
621,"Ah, so they get the ""float"".   I suppose if their money rate is 2.5%, then they can beat that by investing your money elsewhere."
622,"Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary.   Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment).  In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent."
623,It's kind of like collateral.  Less risk for lender equals a liitle lower rate in addition to use of funds.
624,"If I max out the MSDs I can get a 24 month/10,000 miles per year lease on a 2016 i3 REX for less than $90 per month with no money down."
625,"Yeah, I figured you could score an amazing lease deal as an employee. That's a $50k car, right?"
626,Yep; I could also get a 2016 M3 lease on the same terms for about $600/month.
627,So what qualifications does one need to be a genius at a BMW store?
628,"You must be a judge, or at least, a lawyer."
629,Some programs are anomalies and counter-intuitive.
630,What do the max MSDs total out as?
631,It's the monthly payment rounded up to the next $50 increment times 7.
632,"So, couple thousand?"
633,"I leased a 2011 Z4 service loaner for $335/mo, all in.   Seven MSDs were $2450.  Save $46/mo. on a 24 month lease.  (insanely cheap lease... original MSRP of $55K)"
634,"If the lease payment is $350, then $2450 total."
635,"On Bimmerfest I'm seeing people posting leases on a i3REX for $189/m That is with max MSD's and min down (tax, Doc, 1st pmt)"
636,"Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let"
637,Infiniti:   9 MSDs at .00010 each (.00090 total)
638,You would be foolish to lease one of these brands and not take full advantage of the savings. Depending on the MB  dealer most are supported  who  offer MSD.
639,"Dino it is being judgmental, but many people would agree with you, on BF some 23 yr old out of college wanting to lease a new 340i, his payments are $600/m cough.... Should he have gotten that car, no, but no one was going to stop him, and BMWFS sure wasn't.."
640,"MB has MSD, but they aren't offered in all states, just like Audi as well as BMW."
641,"This is true, however, there are people who don't have 4K sitting around in a bank."
642,What is the average monthly car payment nationwide?  For both leases and buyers?  I bet it wouldn't take a year of saving car payments to save up that $4K for most people.
643,"According to Edmunds.com, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $479. IF one wanted to make money on about 4K, one would use MSD's and save $50/m which is about 1900 on a three year lease. I can tell you one could get a nice 528i for $480/m with the currently RV that BMWFS is giving..."
644,"Right is right, that's why I wrote ""too judgmental"".  Anyway, one can do whatever they want, but I can also voice my opinion about the action.  I just don't want to hear their complaints about Bush, Obama, bankers, Wall Street, or global warming next time their life and income prospects turn less then anticipated."
645,"I remember that Forbes, some time ago, did a survey asking American families if they would go into crisis if one month's salary failed to arrive. The response was very unsettling."
646,Probably just as bad today if not worse.
647,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia
648,Maybe that's Cadillac's intent....to cut away more marginal dealers who can't/won't offer a higher level of customer service.
649,Auto dealers have a huge of influence at the state and Federal level. For better or worse it makes it difficult for automakers to bring their dealers to heel.
650,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project.  In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent."
651,"My BMW dealer is setting up a satellite location to sell and service CPO cars- although service for other BMWs will still be offered there, the focus will be on CPO cars."
652,"The issue is, a non-related entity could also offer authorized service, at least in theory.  Service does not have to be tied to sales.  In this case, a Buick dealer could offer Cadillac service in small town.  Or even it could be an completely independent provider, as long as the certification process is transparent and demanding enough.   Unless there are some franchise laws, preventing such decoupling.  Looking what kind of BS Tesla faced in some states, you never know."
653,"A reporter would like to talk with drivers who frequently have to deal with wind throb -- i.e. the sound that occurs when you have a rear window down and the front window up. If you'd like to share your experience, please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by no later than August 8, 2016."
654,"So here is the first car from Hyundai new product line Genesis, impressive, but I think they have missed the mark on a few things, some of the switch gear looks like it came from an accent.."
655,quite a large boat.  Definitely won't be on my shopping list.
656,"And, with a starting price north of $60K, probably out of your budget, too."
657,"well yeah, unless they want to lease me one for $300/mo. S&D, just to get some on the road."
658,I can't see why they would turn that deal down!
659,"I'm guessing they will depreciate heavily, so if you want one, just hang out a few years."
660,"well, I do like to think of myself as a trend setter.  So maybe if I offer to put a decal on it, and talk it up here?"
661,My neighbor just bought a loaded  2016 V-6 Genesis .   The new electronic 3 mode  suspension  is Eon's  better than my  13 R-Spec Genesis. She is coming out of a 2012 E350. She loves the Genesis . I have 15k on mine and really enjoy this   429 h/p  RWD model. Hyundai's 17 speaker 7.1 surround sound Lexicon system is special. Maybe  a tab below the Levinson or  Acura's  ELS system.  .  I would consider buying a left over 2017 or CPO at the end of 2017. I would go for the V-6  that's plenty fast for me these days
662,What does a well-used Phateon go for these days? Lol.
663,"my budget, your budget, &"
664,True enough.
665,I like the lines on this S90 looks sharp. love the blue  color.  I'm not a fan of any 4cyl / turbo  in a car this heavy. I'd like to put this S90 up against the 17 Hyundai Genesis. I'd think in the looks dept. Volvo has the Genesis beat.
666,There's something familiar about that styling>
667,"So stopped by the MB dealer and looked at the GLC and the new C Class coupe, liked the GLC a big improvement over the GLK it replaced.. Now the car that really blew me away was the new C- coupe looks like a mini S coupe MB had a home run with this car, didn't drive it, just wanted to look at it."
668,my son drove a C class coupe friday.  I rode in the back (won't do that again).  He was in lust with it.  Impressive car if yuo want a 2 door.
669,"Drove up Palomar mountain hauling donkey butt today.  At the top met a nice young couple in a '03 Honda S2000 with 95,000 miles that he said he got a couple thousand miles ago for 10 grand.  Last of the 9K redline units he said.  Bumble bee yellow with black interior, top down.  He said it was only 2,500 pounds and was riding on 255/??R17 Enkei lightweight wheels on extreme summer tires.  Also saw a Ferrari club arrive just after I did going up the other direction that I chose.  Included a McClaren and Maserati in the group."
670,"I miss Palomar, I always liked the east side best, always had breakfast at Mothers at the top."
671,"Drove a previous generation MB GLK, 2015, today at work. Loved the way it drove though not a big fan of driving a box around. Great engine with shift points that were so unobtrusive, I had to look at the tach a few times to make sure the car was indeed changing gears...totally seemless and quiet, was a real pleasure to drive and would be very happy to have a CPO model as my daily driver. Sure the mpg's are in the toilet but one doesn't purchase any luxury vehicle like this to get econocar gas mileage. Just like the maintenance, one just knows going in that driving these type of vehicles will cost more but it definitely is worth it for anyone who loves the automobile!"
672,So Car and Driver have a couple of interesting short take test drive
673,So it appears BMW will be bring over a 4 door 2 series for MY2018 I guess they think that segment will grow
674,"In the unlikely event anyone here would consider an Acura TLX as their entry-level luxury car, right now Edmunds is offering an exclusive $1500 incentive on that car. Once that's applied, I think someone could get a base 2016 TLX for close to the price of an Accord EXL, c. 26k. I considered this option, but ultimately decided the Accord EX was good enough for me, and it can be had for c. 3k less. Anyway, below, I think, is a link for the TLX incentive..."
675,I am considering it. In 15 months. Not sure it will last that long.
676,"BMW currently has some insane residual value on leases of 2016 5 series. 67% on 10K/36 month lease, 66% on a 12K/36 and 65% on 15K/36 month,"
677,"And if you use MSD to buy down the MF, you can end up with a pretty amazing lease payment."
678,"In a bit over two months I'll have 90 days in, so I'm hoping BMW FS still has some attractive leases on something I find interesting..."
679,"Re: the TLX, I had a 2005 TL that I sold recently at 156K miles. The TLX is the newer incarnation of that car, and with the somewhat improved appearance, I'm wondering why it seems the TLX doesn't sell anything like the '04-10-ish one did. I know it got ugly with the beak but it seems that it is at least decent looking now."
680,"I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland."
681,"I think that's it.   They thought they could cover both the TL and the TSX market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working."
682,"Agreed.  Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX.  Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss.  ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly."
683,"Yeah, but doesn't MSD sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?"
684,"Sort of... but, you get the money back at lease end.   It's too good of a deal to pass up, in most cases.  (even if the purpose of a lease is to not tie up a wad of cash)."
685,"Not really.  Since it's a deposit, you get the money back.  Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money.  So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition).  Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money.  MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction).  Not even close.  Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO."
686,3 whole years with the same car? Perish the thought.
687,I like seeing old reviews by MotorWeek.  Found this one last night.  Seems as if Acura's current perceived value issues have deep roots.....
688,"Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:"
689,"Yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4K sitting around."
690,"You get the MSD back at the end of your lease, PLUS save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. So it's a win/win for you and BMW gets to use the MSD for 3 yrs. You are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
691,If I remember correctly. Buying 1 MSD point  down  up to  Seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the MF. The only Cons I see is coming up with the extra cash. If your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. If you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your MSD money. Where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront  investment in 3 yrs??  Its a good deal
692,"That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number.    .00007 and .00049"
693,"Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car.  But that's probably just my weird math sense."
694,"When it comes to transmissions the Premium A4 get's the CVT, if you move up to the Premium Plus and Prestige they get the DSG. I just wish Audi would move to a RWD platform."
695,"not according to their site.  Looks like DSG on the premium too, FWD or AWD."
696,"I'm going out on a limb and saw that that isn't correct, every 2017 A4 that North Scottsdale Audi has, has a CVT transmission, the salesmen said that the Premium gets the CVT and the DSG on the other models."
697,"A lot of people aren't happy that the MT is on it's way out, but the current crop of DSG and Auto transmissions really make it hard for people not to agree, I love the 8 spd in our BMW's"
698,"DSG might not have the smoothest of shifting characteristics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out consistent 4-1/2 second OR LESS 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the DSG, how can one honestly complain?"
699,I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually
700,"Just poking around, I am noticing a few brand new 2015 leftover S4s still sitting on dealer lots.  What gives?  Is there no lease support, so the 2016s (which you can lease) are moving off the lots?"
701,"RR even in the M3 and M4 the DSG are wonderful, just as you said you can go from Cruise mode to toy mode with a push of a button. It's like having two cars in one. Some years back Rick had a Mini convertible as a rental it was the non turbo model, and that car could not get out of it's own way, a MT was needed in that car."
702,"Audi has dropped lease support on all 2015's, making them more expensive to lease than the 2016's."
703,"I just spent a few minutes building my own Audis on the Audi Website.  There hasn't been a vehicle out within reason in quite a few years that I actually cared enough to look, so hats off to Audi.  They caught my discerning eye."
704,I saw a gorgeous WHITE S3 tonight!
705,There's a white S3 parked outside our office building these days - I agree it's very sharp with the contrasting black panoramic sunroof.
706,"So Friday my local BMW dealer had a driving event, Drive for the Cause, it was held on friday and of course no one was there for it at 11am, so Rick and I had all the cars to ourselves. They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also  has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be."
707,"Couldn't imagine why the masses didn't show up to drive cars in 115 degree heat.  Oh wait, maybe I can."
708,I don't think it was the heat that caused more like it was on a Friday morning and some people might have to work..
709,Yes they do
710,"I walked a row at the BMW dealer today (some of their new cars).  Had to read the backs to figure out what was what.  So many looked not all that much different from each other. 2's at least were coupes.  But the 3, 4 GT, GCs, all blurred together."
711,"Interesting wasn't aware there was a 4GT, that would have stood out, but then again, 3 series is a sedan and a 4 series is a coupe, they all look alike I guess"
712,"There you go, the stars are trying to tell you to get a 6 series..."
713,maybe I mixed that up in the alphabet soup.  Might have been 4 GC and 3 GT.  they don't make it easy to keep straight.
714,"Lol!  I'd have to wait for you & Rick to buy a moderately priced 640i GC X-Drive (my wife prefers blue), and then buy it from you second hand for somewhere less than 50% of the car's original MSRP when you are done with it!"
715,"Yes the N63 (engine code) has had problems and it appears BMW has a fix, the truly sad part really is, Audi and MB both have TT V8 and don't have problems with theirs. I had thought about a 550 in the past but after researching the N63 issues and the factory fix, I'm not totally convinced they have it fixed. Here are a could of threads on Bimmerfest regarding the N63 engine problems."
716,"Stick, the same can be said about Audi, MB, Infiniti, Lexus if one really isn't into a brand then  yes all the cars even sedans and coupes look a like.."
717,"Forgot to answer this, I have 47K miles on El Cheapo and never had a mechanical issue with it, of that 39K or so is with the Stage 1."
718,"So here is a short write up on the new Volvo S90, very promising."
719,Their Series 5 BMW competitor really needed an upgrade like that. The older S80 had a horrendous depreciation rate.  Losing 58% of your car's value in 3 years isn't an encouragement to buy.
720,I do extended test drives all the time.
721,How about expanding on this then just say you do it...  What manufacture allows and what is an extended test drive to you?
722,"Ray Catena MB, Bmw, Audi, Maserati  in  NJ will let you take one of there pre assigned Audi's, MB or BMW, Maserati  for a good part of the day. Some of these cars , Suv's are upper management  Vehicles.  Not many  dealers will let you have a vehicle like this that long.  I have a long standing with Catena.  I call in  the morning  tell them what I want to drive and its never been a problem.  They treat there customers like gold."
723,Is a day really an extended test drive?  But its nice to know that there is a dealership willing to give customers a car like this
724,I was just making a joke regarding my habit of buying and trading cars more often than I should.
725,I was just making a joke regarding my habit of buying and trading cars more often than I should.
726,Even an hour drive can tell you way more than 5 minutes around the block
727,"Last time we shopped multiple makes/dealers, we had plenty of them offer to give us the car overnight.    Actually took one of them up on it, as my wife hates going to car dealers, and the car was for her."
728,"If you’re contemplating a fairly mainstream vehicle, you can often rent one from Hertz or Enterprise.  Toyota Camry, Chevy Impala, Chrysler Town and Country, no problem.  If you’re looking at a Jaguar or Land Rover, well, a lot harder."
729,"Interesting take!  At the end of the day, if the enthusiast really wants one of these cars, it's still going to knock on the door of high $40s or low $50s to get one to perform the way we'd expect."
730,"Some dumb entries in there, IMHO. First, how do you have 2 different ""entry-level"" BMWs. Entry level is 1 level only. If they were close on price, I suppose I could see the argument, but the 4 GC is $8k more for starters. My other problem is the inclusion of a VW. Audi takes their luxo sales slot."
731,Well you know the argument...the highest trim level of the lower price brand approximates the stripper model of the next higher level brand.
732,"I'm sure it is a nice car and all, but if you gotta go to the top of the brand's offerings, then you completely leave out the ""entry level"" part of the equation."
733,Well you know car mags are always stretching definitions so that they can concoct yet another story for yet another issue.
734,Like the edmunds 340i with a multitude of options that make it a $60K 3 series?
735,"A reporter is looking to speak with someone over the age of 50 who recently purchased a new vehicle within the last six months. If you're willing to assist, please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by June 2, 2016."
736,Like the edmunds 340i with a multitude of options that make it a $60K 3 series?
737,"I'm assuming the ""Get Off My Lawn"" package includes the Helen Keller features, plus others too numerous to mention."
738,GOML Package
739,"Car and Driver just tested a 2017 S3, I haven't had time to read the article but I thought I would post it, I'm going to look at 2017 Audi A4 tomorrow."
740,Has anyone heard from markincincinati?  I think his last post was in February.
741,"Good question.  He cut way back a few years ago, possibly due to having to spend much more time on his business, but I don't remember him being gone this long before."
742,FN...would be interested in your take on the new A4.
743,Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.
744,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX..."
745,Looks like Audi is on the right track.  Make a great car.  Slowly make improvements based on customer/media feedback as the model progresses.
746,"I thought the A4 was using the normal AT, not the dual clutch box?  Which is fine by me for one of these!"
747,"I think the '17 A4 has simply gone standard dual clutch auto, at least in Quattro form, but I haven't seen one in person very closely yet, nor driven one."
748,"looks like you are correct.  Must be confusing it with the old style, but looks like the A4 is DSG, though the site just mentions base FWD, I'm sure it is the same with Quattro."
749,"Oh goodie, Audi got added to the previously only High-end list."
750,Someone posted this on the Caddy board I frequent. It is a really good interview. He is an impressive individual with all the right answers.
751,"A lot of noise was made on the boards here when Acura replaced everybody's beloved TL with ""the beak"" with the 2009 redesign.  It was too much and way to aggressive.  The 2012 facelift was subsequently criticized for being too conservative.  I happen to be in the minority.  I like the old TL Type S which is still a great looking car close to 10 years out of production.  I like the 2009 - 2011 SH AWD models because of their aggressive looking rear end with tail pipes sticking out the back & squared off 5 Spoke Wheels.  I also dig the look of the 2012 - 2014 SH AWD models.  Many people also don't like the sea of black, white, silver, & grey ELLPS out there.  Check out what I saw on the way home yesterday."
752,"I saw a previous generation yesterday. (2004-2008?), TL-S model.     Was thinking about how nice that body style holds up.."
753,That TL is a total respray.  That's not a color Acura offers in the TL.
754,I know it the car was repainted & that's not a stock Acura color.  I just thought it stands out.
755,"I am still fond of the TLX, and it is on the list for next year.  But would get a 4 cyl DCT"
756,"After dad gave me his clean 95 Cutlass Ciera because he could no longer drive, I drove it for about 2 years and sold my 01 Aurora 4.0.  When the Ciera needed expensive a/c repair, I cut bait, and it was a great excuse to get another car.  I bought a very clean 03 Acura TL with 20k, silver, black interior.  This was in 05.  For some reason, the TL just hit me as being blah, nothing special, though the V6 felt and sounded great.   I guess I should have bought the TL-S instead.  Enter black 06 Passat 2.0t---a fun and nice driving car.  Like stickguy, I have my eye on a TLX w/tech as a possible future purchase."
757,"I received a phone call from Scottsdale Jaguar, they have the new XE in, will be stopping by today to look at them, they have 5, 4 base and 1 premium. I'll have to look at the F-Pace too."
758,"I received a letter from my Jag dealer.  They want to buy back my '13 XF for 20% over ""book value*.""  They're desperate for used cars.  And, they'd be glad to get me into a new set of wheels.  For 20% over MSRP, of course!"
759,"I like those too - test drove one a while back and was impressed with the package overall.  In my area, the dealers have some low mileage 4 cyl tech models (loaners probably) for right at $30k or a bit under.  As I like to say, lot of car for the money."
760,"Perhaps I'm the only one, but I like how Acura has gone back to its tagline from the 1990s: ""Precision Crafted Performance."""
761,a big discount on a 4 cyl tech would give me all I need.
762,"I like those too - test drove one a while back and was impressed with the package overall.  In my area, the dealers have some low mileage 4 cyl tech models (loaners probably) for right at $30k or a bit under.  As I like to say, lot of car for the money."
763,I'm tempted to look at an accord hybrid.
764,Boo!
765,Better overall than a V6 model.
766,Boo!
767,Have you driven a 6-cylinder Accord lately?  I wonder if that would be the way to go for what would probably be less than the 4-banger Acura.  Always liked Honda/Acura's V6's.
768,Boo!
769,"So went to the Jaguar Dealer, I was much more impressed with the F-Pace then I was with the XE. The XE still has a tight rear legroom then my F30 or Ricks F34. But the F-Pace is nice, the one on the showroom did not have real leather, but their fake leather and was impressed with how it felt, very rich feel to it. The 340 hp V6 was nice, pulled strong. The F-Pace is the same size as BMW's X5 and it under cut the X5 by 7K. This was the first time I had a chance to really look at Jaguar up close and the salesman was not pushy at all. The F pace comes in Diesel and Gas, beginning of June they get their first diesel F Pace, I can't wait to drive it. Regarding the XE for a base model, at 34K you get more standard equipment then the 328, A4 and C300, the fit and finish was perfect on the two XE's that I looked it. I hope this is a good sign for Jaguar."
770,"the F pace is that big?  I thought it was based on the XE, so more along the size of an X3?"
771,"I thought they drove nice, and were pretty quick.  Or so I have heard."
772,"That is what I thought, but the salesperson explained the ""F"" in Pace. The F-pace is based off the XF there will be a E-Pace within the next year. Also something interesting, Look for Jaguar to set up a bank i.e Jaguar Financial Services soon, like like what BMW and MB has done. He explained that they currently use Chase Bank, so lease rates should come down as well as top tier rates for people who have a credit score above 675, this is the cut off for BMW top tier rate."
773,Just hears a quote that pertains to everyone here....
774,""" I hope this is a good sign for Jaguar."""
775,"One of my good friends has the TLX V6 Advanced Package, it's not AWD but it does have the 9 speed transmission.  He loves the car except for the transmission, I've driven it on several occasions and the shifts from 1-2 and 2-3 are really harsh."
776,"Sometimes, when you encounter something like that, you get used to it and don't even really notice it after a while."
777,What manufacture allows extensive test drives these and what do you consider extensive anyhow?
778,"They aren't all that far off. My caddy has quite generous coverage, actually. 4/50k B-2-B, 6/70k powertrain, and 4/50k included service."
779,Volvo has free service for that long at least I believe.  or close to it.  VW offers 1 year (used to be 3).  Or maybe it is 2 now?  They kept changing it.
780,"I get a Caddy loaner whenever I went in for service.  Tired to coax them out of a ATS-V they had sitting there as a loaner once, but they said they couldn't."
781,Interesting Article:
782,This is volvo's:
783,"BMW and Jag, however, BMW will stop the 4/50 after the MY16 cars. will be 3/36"
784,What's going on with Cadillac the past few years reminds me a little bit of Oldsmobile in the late 1990s.
785,"BMW includes wear items though, including brakes and wipers I'm told.  However, they do exclude tires."
786,Wear items are no longer warranted by BMW from 2017 forward.
787,"Wow, what's happening? Why is BMW cutting maintenance and warranty?  This is effectively a price increase.  Looks like pushing the lease even harder than before.  Also seems like a very weak statement about confidence in this new and improved product.  Too many problems with turbo engines? Hoarding cash for a future dieselgate?  What gives?"
788,"I thought BMW already leased a very high percentage of cars?  If so, makes sense to cut back.  Most likely though it was just a way to shave costs without raising prices, and not something buyers will immediately feel."
789,"BMW is selling cars do they don't have to do the free maintenance any longer, but Jag will have to do it for a while to get people to trust them, I'm hoping that Alfa does the same thing with their cars too. It's nice to know you wont have to pay for anything.."
790,"They do, but shortening the coverage will make them even more dependent on leases.  I'm sure a good extension and certified preowned programs coukd bridge the gap.  I just hate ""sneak"" price hikes, like changing the packaging, or cutting 0.2 inches of width from paper towel or toilet tissue rolls.  I like straight talk and treatment, not slight of hand moves."
791,"That would be sad as Olds was shut down.  Doubt they would do that to Cadillac, but never say never."
792,"As much as those that really look at the math (like you and me) value the maintenance program, BMW decided that the marketing value of the plan didn't justify their increased costs.    They are probably correct.    Unfortunately."
793,"Maybe BMW will go back to maintenance schedules that help the car last hundreds of thousands of miles, as long as they don't have to pay for it.  I'm not holding my breath, however."
794,not happening as long as they are paying for it.
795,Maybe BMW has confidence that their cars are now more reliable than they used to be?
796,"Saw a beautiful 328i, blue over beige, not sure the year but gorgeous. Having never owned a BMW, will definitely be looking for a CPO unit in a few years once I go into retirement again. By then, my driving should go down substantially so it'll be mostly around town stuff. Just wish they still made the 128 as I love the smaller size, anything from 170"" down is my preferred size now as it's usually me in the vehicle or me and the wife as the kids usually meet us in their own rides or we take a couple to our destination."
797,"If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance.  Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back.  So it could end up being worthless."
798,"By cutting the warranty?  I don't follow. Maintenance is one thing, but warranty is another."
799,I hadn't heard that the warranty was being cut.... just the maintenance.
800,"I tried to corroborate and found a confirmation for the maintenance cut and couple of dealers listing new 2017 vehicles with 4/50 warranty and 3/36 maintenance.  Looks, like I might have misunderstood.  I thought Fligthnurse wrote about both warranty and maintenance being cut, but perhaps not."
801,"IT's not to take effect until MY17, Only the maintenance is being cut not the bumper to bumper warranty, however, I think the bumper to bumper warranty isn't transferable since My16."
802,"I think it's the maintenance that's not transferable.  Warranty is - essentially all brands have warranty transferable, except there are some exceptions in Kia/Hyundai ""extensions"" in warranties beyond 3/36, but I don't know the details on those exceptions."
803,"Trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but BMW saved themselves a ton of money.  Probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some AWD services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things.  But, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined."
804,"And, given that a majority of BMWs are leased for 36 months, I don't think they are offending that segment of their customers by dropping the 4th year."
805,"Not covering wear items at all, from what I understand, so no wipers or brake jobs.  I've received brake jobs on at least one axle, on every BMW we've had."
806,"That's why I'm so disappointed.  3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based.  My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently.  There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition."
807,Still looking:
808,"Wow, Civic purchases are on fire and the hose on Cadillac.  I think part of Cadillac's issue is pricing, just too high.  Nice cars, however, and wouldn't mind having an ATS or CTS in my driveway."
809,Nice to see Acura holding on.
810,Volvo is up over 22% YTD vs 2015.
811,Some rug and furniture stores have been doing that for decades.
812,I read an article somewhere that this is due almost entirely to the sales of the new XC90.
813,"OH, I'm certain it is."
814,Spotted an STS-V on Monday.   That has to be pretty rare.
815,I don't know what Cadillac is going to do; they have a world class product but perception is taking much too long to catch up with reality...
816,"Perhaps review their pricing model, study Lexus circa 1989..."
817,Exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors.
818,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels.  It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network.  They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market."
819,The sad thing is that Cadillac HAS good products.  Between
820,"It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay.  So either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels.  Something's got to give.  Mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves."
821,"I completely agree, but they spent 30+ years destroying the brand, it won't recover overnight."
822,Lots of truth in your last paragraph!
823,Well said
824,"couldn't agree more. No idea why they just don't lower their prices. I mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests AND undercut their prices. You lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."
825,"Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more.  Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount.  Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer.   Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."
826,CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?
827,"FN...Cadillac took the '14 CTS back.  I was still PO'd but they gave me a new '16 and some pocket money for my troubles.  '16 is what the '14 should have been.  CTS came out of the blocks about 18 months before it was fully baked, at least in my case."
828,"""For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars. """
829,"If I get a jag, will definitely be a lease, so they only need to survive 4 years more from now!"
830,"Where in the interior do you find it lacking? Just doing a quick comparo online, the CTS has 4.4"" more front legroom than the E and 4.3"" more than the 5. It falls right in the middle with rear legroom at only 0.4"" less than the E but 0.1"" more than the 5."
831,"The Jag F-Pace, like the XE, is getting very good early press. Automobile Mag (online, at least) has a ""first and second"" drive impression articles, they're still looking for faults."
832,"Congrats on the new car, is this one a 4 cyl or 6 cyl?"
833,"I like the  XF will give it a look, should have written that."
834,They need to do something unconventional to win back the trust.
835,A 10 year warranty with a guaranteed loaner/rental when needed would help speed that along.
836,"Depending where you live there are some great deals on BMWs right now. my neighbor just leased a 2015 535d new, MSRP $77K, purchase price $59K, with the 3K lease money BMW has his money payments on this car is $525/m with ZERO out of pocket. He got the car from Pacific BMW in Glendale, Ca. They have a huge selection of cars from new with zero miles, to service loaners to Exec cars."
837,Here is a good lease on a 335i
838,"It's OK .. over $5K due at signing, but you'll get the $3850 back at the end. Oh, plus DMV and dealer fee costs, whatever those happen to be."
839,"Not to mention that this has got to be for 10K miles per year (so what do I drive for the other 6 months?).  So after 3 years you'll have paid out over $19,000 in lease payments (plus tax).  I think they are marking up the bank fee by $200."
840,"$925 is the new standard acquisition fee for BMWFS.     No markups allowed, now."
841,I stand corrected!
842,"That isn't a very good deal, I'm sure you would walk into the dealership and get it for less. Also With that payment the MF isn't at the base rate. The GT's aren't selling that well."
843,You're also losing one month's lease payment in the investment interest you would lose on giving them $3850 of your money for 3 years.
844,"This is one area where the dealer makes money, other then the lovely Doc Fee"
845,"its seems difficult to decide, seriously."
846,"One thing people don't get with MSD's is over the life of the lease, you are saving on average about $1900 plus you get the MSD's back when you turn the car"
847,"Yeah but the dealer can jack up the MF, and if they do that to the max as Michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest;  and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation  at turn-in."
848,"that was something I wondered about with the MSDs.  On my lease, there is no security deposit, so if they want to ding me for damage, they have to ask for it and I can argue.  But if they have $3,500 ""on account"", they can keep whatever they want, and I would have to fight them to get it back."
849,EGG-xactly my concern as well.
850,"This can happen and does at any dealership, but this is why the savvy buyer would investigate what the current MF is and call the dealer on the increase."
851,"From what I have read on Bimmerfest, BMW has not done this since the MSD is not really a ""security"" deposit in the general term, but a way to lower the MF."
852,Depends on what's in the contract--it should state (or not) whether the MSD can be used against damages at turn-in.
853,"I agree with the thought process on this... It's the same reason I don't use a debit card.   But, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in).   You owe what you owe, regardless of deposit."
854,"True enough but there are shades of gray as to what represents ""significant damage"". I've also heard of cases where one inspection seeeds rather perfunctory, and another very  detailed. Go figure."
855,"I haven't run into that.   Twice was with MSDs, but I've turned in at least 8-10 leased cars, with never an issue."
856,"I was going to post something like this, I would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then I get could see BMW holding back some money."
857,"I had a rented A3 sedan this past week. I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. While I realize it was probably a base model, the interior, while nice, had quite a bit of hard door plastics, etc. IMHO the dash looks kind of cheap with the worst part being the round air vents. The driving feel was ok but not great. The engine (I assume it was a Turbo 4?) was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration. The leather seats were decent and the car looks attractive."
858,"Can't argue with you that it seems Audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation  A3's interior.  I love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement.  The driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me.  The 1.8T I'm not a fan of; the 2.0T should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time.  Before someone argues, note the 2.0T adds quattro without losing MPG, that's better efficiency by a large margin.  The 2.0T is a stellar engine."
859,"I couldn't toss it as I pretty much drove the freeways. Also my rental seemed to bottom out the front right shock as if there was no damping - it was a huge chunk on speedbumps, etc. So I had to baby it a bit - but the car had 18K miles on it so don't know how that had happened. I reported it to the rental company upon return."
860,I wonder when rental companies will start installing dash cams into the cars to see just how abused rentals are during rental periods.
861,The Quattro version comes with a more powerful engine...
862,"We love our A3 with the 1.8T engine to be honest. Not one problem so far, only has been back to the dealer for their gratis wash/vacuum. Our first time going german and we are very pleased. So pleased in fact, that 12 days later, I went to our local VW store and bought a Golf hatch for myself. Had less cash to spend and wanted the versatility of a hatch to haul stuff. So far, only one issue with a starter wire that took a few days to find malfunctioning. But after a couple of days, the problem finally showed itself and that was that. Also, the lumbar handle came off twice and now fixed perfectly."
863,"Do you know if your wife's A3 is still made in Germany (VIN start with W), and the Golf probably made in Mexico (VIN number starts with 3 I think).  After solving the Mexican teething quality control issues, I""m sure your Golf will serve you as well as any Honda for reliability and durability."

868,"Congrates on the new M235, When the new M2 arrives in the next month or two, that will be worthy of the M badge..  Regarding the M Adaptive Suspension, I was really taken how it transforms the car when you toggle from C to S. It's like having two cars..."
869,"I liked the M2, but it wasn't within my current budget. That said, at the M2's price point the GT350 is a compelling alternative. I'd have to spend considerable seat time in both to make the call."
870,"Having just driven a M3, Mustang GT and GT350 back to back, I give it to the GT350, for me it hits all the right points. Plus the sound that V8 makes is erotic (to me.) When I'm ready for next car it's going to be tough to choose."
871,"A major selling point for the GT350 is the flat plane V8- it's significantly different from the Mustang GT engine. As for as price goes, the GT350 has the edge on paper; the trick is finding a dealer that actually has a car to sell- and isn't tacking on a $25k ADM sticker..."
872,"I can't stand ADM stickers, but there are morons who pay them so who am I to judge?  I actually know 2 people who paid them."
873,"So he paid what? Maybe $60K?...and 9 years later it's worth 1/2 that---not too bad, really, even with the ADM."
874,The guy with the Shelby?  I guess not.
875,"You can order a M3/M4 that comes in under the 65K mark, the only option I would get on them is M Adapative Suspension, for 1K that is it. But the GT350 fully loaded in far less then that. When it comes to the ADM well just wait, that will go away too."
876,"Okay, need a legend here.  What does EDC and AMS stand for?"
877,Sorry! EDC= Electronic Damper Control AMS= Adaptive M Suspension
878,"Congratulations, Roadburner on your new M235i.  An M235i convertible is at the top of my wish list and I think, like you, I'll like the size performance and features.  The resemblance to the great E46 doesn't hurt either.  Like you I've given some thought to various Mustangs but they're just to big for me.  I wonder if they've improved the weight  distribution.  My '86 5 liter  convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup."
879,"well, the 2014s are already right around $30k at auction, putting them around $33k retail. Sooo... what time is it now?"
880,I'd agree.
881,"I will say I was impressed with how my AWD Q50 handled a 10"" snow (large for NC).  We don't have the equipment to clear streets, so most were unplowed when I went out.  Ground clearance was the only real issue, and that didn't keep it from getting through the snow, you just heard it underneath."
882,"I had to take in my S4 for its first warranty replacement part at 42K+ miles yesterday.  The right headlight low beam bulb ""burned out/broke.""  Indicator light was very specific about problem with the right side headlight low beam bulb.  Audi covered it, although there was a mention that sometimes they might like to wiggle out of paying for bulbs."
883,"I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I creased the side of my ti I took it to my local dealer's BMW Certified Collision Repair Center. The quality of the work was outstanding, and I had absolutely no complaints. Was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an Audi certified shop?"
884,"Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County!  However, they were so horrible, I imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though I haven't had luck with any body shops in San Diego County yet (tried 4 different ones now)."
885,"I would pay extra for a policy that has ""new car replacement"" even if your car isn't totaled, but has more than a 20% of value damage claim.  I'd also pay extra to have a collision deductible waiver that applies to both uninsured and under insured drivers hitting you.  Unfortunately in CA at least, it's better to be hit by an uninsured than a under insured driver."

887,"So for 2016 Infiniti has an entry level Q50 with a 4 cyl turbo, so is Infiniti doing the BWW thing with a El Cheapo model?"
888,"BMW? Heck, almost every luxury brand offers a 4-cyl turbo in their entry level cars."
889,"Well Audi has always had a 4 cyl,"
890,So very open ended question -- but I would really appreciate opinions.  I currently lease a 2014 Lexus IS250 AWD.  Its fine -- has worked out well for me.
891,"I think you answered your own question.  scope them all out, see which ones interest you enough to get into a short term relationship with, then go where the money trail leads."
892,"Yes, the IS350 is light years better than the IS250.  Still, if you want great power it's 335+, S3 or S4, or AMG versions of the above."
893,"You can build the new A4 at Audi's website now.  Trims and packages seem to be simplified from the last model, at least for now.  Again, I think the DSG and ""upgraded"" 2.0t make it an attractive and competitive choice."
894,Forgot to mention.  A WRX should have a stick shift.  Not a CVT.  Not negotiable.
895,"Actually, I liked the CVT in the Legacy (or at least, never noticed it, which is a good thing).  A perfectly fine solution for that car."
896,"I was thinking that maybe we could tweak the software to delete the term ""CVT"", when appearing in the same post with the letters ""WRX"""
897,"Drove CVT Legacy.  Good mileage, but the whining engine wasn't much pleasure.  Lots of noise, not much acceleration above 60 mph."
898,"Acuras are funny like that.  They sell cheap for new, but then they don't really depreciate.  TL SH AWDs which sold for what $35K when new the last 2 years of production still have asking prices as CPO cars in the high $20s to low $30K range."
899,"I think at low end it is quicker than it feels, but once the ratios change at higher speeds, it really is sluggish.  But it can be worse - new Chrysler 200 I drove recently was just awful at highway speeds."
900,"NY, now you know why I really really like our A3, t really is a nice looking vehicle. Ours being the base model with the extra safety features besides the back-up camera the wife had to have, it's a great package. It feels like a more expensive vehicle than it is the minute you open the door. As much as I like my Golf, like the A3 even more and the white over black is nice, not a combo I'd choose though. Luckily, she's keeping the mileage down so when the time is right, I'd still have a lower mileage A3."

902,Acura needs a TLX-S with the better 3.7 (vs. 3.5) tuned up to 330+ HP with proper transmission choices.  Or maybe they could turbocharge the old gem of a 3.0 V6.

908,"That's one reason that even though I love driving German cars, I've just had enough of their service and parts prices. Over the years the amount of actual service needed in cars has gone way down - I remember the '70's where I had to replace plugs, oil, adjust valves, timing, replace points and condenser - every 6K miles! It was a VW Bug. But in those days that service at an independent cost like $60. Today you do almost none of those things and yet the service is hundreds of dollars."
909,$60 in 1975 is about $270 today
910,One of the main reasons that I have not strayed too far from BMW is the fact that my dealer has an excellent service department and doesn't try to push unnecessary work. I also get a 20% discount on both parts and labor.

916,"Greetings from sunny Phoenix..  Well the Auction week's are over here and what a event. The Barrett Jackson event is mind blowing on what they have. Here is a link to the top 25 cars sold at all of the auctions that happen, some of the most beautiful cars ever built. While we were there we meet a gentlemen who was in charge of getting the cars on stage, Rick and I will be drivers next year, very much looking forward to this. The process starts next month. Here is the URL for the cars.."
917,"for a LT relationship, a well-rounded performer with rock solid reliability is not a bad thing to have.  Likely better than one that ""wows"" in one area but comes with a lot of other compromises that can wear on you after a while?"
918,"Yes, I much rely on one car to do it all, and I can't have breakdowns.  I don't have the time or money or patience.   My S4 was fixed same day I took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank.   Can I blame this on the body shop or Audi?  I think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance Audi should have made the hoses with better clamps."
919,"Well that 80K marker doesn't mean something outright fails. It means it has become substandard. Many many people drive around quite contentedly with cars, that if subjected to inspection, could justify quite a few repairs. At 80K for instance, your car's struts still work fine, but they aren't anywhere as good as new, and a worn ball joint wouldn't exhibit any difference to the driver. Nor would mushy motor mounts, glazed fan belts, or cracked exhaust hangers."
920,"That 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years.  Since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so.  Heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
921,"Yeah, I would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80K. But parts do wear. Maybe the glove box door is as good at 80K as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80K.  And don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9K miles and how that affects resale value. I think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs.  Not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."
922,I have a co-worker who has a first year new Gen camero with 145K miles on it and no major repairs on it. Of course I told him now that he spoke about it openly he will have problems now with it.
923,I bet we could find some
924,"Perhaps some of that comes from having to replace serpentine belts, timing belts, etc at or near the 100K mile mark?"
925,"Yes I think that's exactly right---usually 100K, or 90K, or maybe 105K,  is a big service and many people skip out before having to do that.  Also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items.  I mean, how many sellers would do ALL those things and then sell the car?"
926,"Well, at the 182,370 mile Oil Service my son's X3 also needed two serpentine belts as well as rear pads and rotors. Oh the horror!!!"
927,"Yeah, but not everyone with a miled up X3 has a knowledgeable dad to fix everything, nor do they have your good luck.  Remember, risk assessment is based on an actuarial. If you just interviewed 100 year old men you'd never predict actual life expectancy."
928,I don't think it's good luck- it's conscientious and consistent maintenance.
929,"And that too! Of course, for that to really work it helps to buy the car new. I'm also conscientious but I've had to pay for the previous owner's neglect sometimes....or worse yet, for the factory's engineering gaffs."
930,"Well, the X3 was practically new; it had 16,500 miles on it and was just over a year old. You are absolutely right about prior owners; they can either enhance the reliability or ""poison the pond"" as it were."
931,"This is why getting a CPO BMW or any other brand that offers free maintenance is usually a good bet, since the new owner doesn't pay for service and can be in and out of a service department in about 15 minutes."
932,"Am thinking that a CPO luxury level vehicle is the best way to buy one used since the company's have a certain check list of things that must be done besides an oil change and tire rotation. Personally, I'd have more confidence in purchasing a vehicle that has been CPO'd than one that hasn't and would be willing to pay a slight premium for it just knowing the odds are in my favor for a more pleasant ownership experience."
933,"Normally, I would want to address the following quote, amplify it or perhaps even counter the point -- Sandman speaks the truth. Perhaps the intent was to update the Hawthorne effect. You decide.  My experience is that if you are into it/them [cars] you will indeed take better care of them -- and be rewarded with reliability."
934,"In case anyone is interested, here is the most recent used oil analysis from my wife's X3(yes, she took it back and sent my son to SC in her old E90 328i- neither of us miss it"
935,"Yes, some people don't realize that fuel contamination is an engine killer! Coolant contamination is certainly a bearing-eater."
936,That X-3 looks like it's running very well.  Interesting to see this.  I never performed an oil sample analysis.
937,"one good thing about the luxo brands is the nice long warranty.  the dealer I have been keeping an eye on has had a number of 2 MY (even some 1 MY) used models, so we are talking 2-3 years elapsed max.  So 1-2 years BtoB + another 2 years powertrain left on it.  So while not certified, still plenty of coverage in case of any bugs it might have when you buy it."
938,A CPO car is only as good as the certifying dealer; I've bought 3 CPO cars from my local BMW dealer and they were all in excellent shape.
939,"I plan to look at Audi, MB and BMW next time and go the CPO route to insure a vehicle that should last a good amount of time. Will pounce on our A3 if she decides to get something else though as her mileage will be pretty low in a few years. If not, leaning towards BMW to see what the fuss is about."
940,"IMNSHO, your only sure bet to get a newer BMW that actually drives-at least a little-like a traditional BMW is to find a Sport/M Sport 2 Series, 3 Series, or 4 Series."
941,"I just got back from filling up my wife's Pilot to the tune of 14 mpg.  At the gas station I saw a guy pull up in an A3.  Black on Black.  Caught my eye enough to come home & build one on the Audi website.  2.0T Quattro Premium (AWD, Pano Roof, 6 Speed STronic) with optional hot seats & sport suspension.  Nice package for a $34,950 sticker price.   220 hp / 258 lb ft torque"
942,you would probably like this one too if B on B is your thing.  A bit more cushy.
943,"one thing I would worry about, knowing some of the bombed out roads you drive on, is how tiring the ride/noise would get commuting in the WRX.  Seems like a much better ""fun"" car to me!"
944,Why would rear brakes be the first to go?  Seems counter-intuitive.
945,Ferodo Street Sport pads.  Expensive? Yes.  Worth it? Yes.
946,Exactly.
947,"Geez, that's BMW 7-series money."
948,Honda's for some reason had a phase where the rears wore out much quicker than the front.  I learned this when it happened to my Accord.
949,"Happened in my (former) TSX & our Pilot as well.  It doesn't make sense as the cars are platforms are FWD & the cars are nose heavy.  One service adviser at a Honda dealer told me it is because they put rear brake pads ""the size of oreo cookies"" on the cars."
950,"Are there other BMW dealers in your area?  If not, sounds like a captive audience and little chance for getting another quote unless an independent shop does the work."
951,"Same with my 06 Passat.  Rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing.  Not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)"
952,"Yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model BMW.    A lot of that is the OEM BMW rotors.   Really, really pricy.      I had my independent do the job with BMW pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors.  Saved about half."
953,"It does seem that way, but typical for BMWs."
954,"I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner.  The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time.  The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K.  I never did the fronts in that time."
955,My 2008 Passat got new brakes on the rear at around 99k miles.  The fronts were still good when I sold the car at around 105k.
956,A while back we were discussing best engines....here's a new list from Wards 10 Best.
957,"Interestingly, the B58 reverts back to a mechanical water pump. However, the timing chain/VANOS assembly is now located at the rear of the engine..."
958,I would also guess the rears would wear faster if you lived on a hill and used the parking break a lot - like my wife does. Maybe wrong on this but who knows - 30k miles and have to do rears hurts when you go to a Honda dealer. Glamor shot time
959,Nice shot!
960,"read the review in one of this month's car magazines on the new A4.  Sounded really nice.  Interior though seemed pretty familiar, but I suspect the fancy new dashboard screen is cool."
961,"With the increased hp on the 2.0t and the DSG trannie, the new A4 does seem very competitive."
962,It's certainly getting some nice reviews.
963,Interesting engine choices from Nissan errr Infiniti
964,actually sounds like they addressed some of the key issues.  I could be tempted by the 2.0t option!
965,"My son brought his 2004 X3 2.5i home from college; it just turned over 182k miles. My wife has been letting him drive her E90 3er while he's home to keep excess miles off his truck. Funny thing; my wife and I both usually prefer light and nimble cars, yet we both like driving his sled more than her E90. I can't put my finger on why exactly- but there it is. Since he's had it at SC it has needed a new battery and a starter, but at that mileage I can't complain too much. The suspension is completely untouched; it's going to the dealer in a couple of days for an Oil Service so we will see if anything needs attention. Even if something does turn up I won't be that upset, as we bought it in 2005 and paid it off in 2007.  It would take a"
966,I did the nursing an old car along long distance once.  Never again.  Plus the thought of my daughter calling me to say she broke down along the side of the DC beltway is terrifying!
967,"Haven't had to do any nursing as I see it; and aside froma bit of interior wear it looks and drives like a car with one-fourth the actual mileage.,"
968,"A lot of this is situational.  If you have 5 vehicles there is always a spare if one if one or two aren't available.  No long commutes or retired with time to spare.  Most depend greatly on one car and don't have the time or want to hassle with repairs.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that keeping a car for the very long term is cheaper.  However, money is not the only or even the main factor for many especially those that buy luxury cars."
969,"Sure it's cheaper because you have amortized the depreciation, and even $150 a month in repairs is 1/2 or 1/3rd a lease or car payment."
970,Sure it is.....who wants to hassle with repairs whether it's covered by warranty or not.  Number of recalls is also a factor.  Sure it gets fixed for free but can be a hassle if not done during routine maintenence.
971,"And then there are the dreadful cases of the dealer being unable to fix the car, even under warranty, or it requiring numerous attempts."
972,"My experiences don't match that - I usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120K, My Acura TL (2005) is at 155K right now and I had my first significant repair at around 130K, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.). And that has been about it other than the routine stuff. I also had a Jetta go to 143K, an Accord go way over 100K with no issues, and a Mercury Villager with the first big repair around 170K."
973,331 at the wheels isn't enough?  Is everyone big daddy Don Garlits now?
974,331 hp at the wheels is decent but nothing extraordinary.
975,"Less than one wants, more than one needs."
976,Please tell us how numbers can be conjurer?
977,"Seems like you can add in a correction factor prior to the pull or you can mess with  the pressure sensors. Some types of dynos would be easier to cheat on than others of course.   Dynos, after all, are a major sales tool."
978,"So you can't point to any one company but you are willing to post that we shouldn't trust these dyno runs because of ""possible"" issues? I highly doubt that BMS will post wrong info, they aren't a big company that could hire a PR firm to undo the damage of such wrong claims."
979,"I never implied anything of the sort with BMS.  Advising people to research data from impartial sources rather than the manufacturer seems like good advice to me, whether it's ""lasts three times as long as leading deodorant"" or ""highest interest CD available today"".  Consumer Reports built an empire on this very principle.  If a manufacturer's claims are substantiated they are rewarded."
980,"Did you read the article that I posted?  I don't think you did.... It was a Beta test, more testing to come."
981,Well since BMW quotes the power of the 340 to be at 320hp. I would think 331 is a excellent number.
982,"It is a good number compared to the advertised hp, but 331 hp isn't all that extraordinary compared to a lot of other performance cars on the market. stickguy's comment made it sound as it 331 hp is some astronomical power number and it just"
983,"I guess my sarcasm didn't come across.  I agree, a leaky washer fluid tank is hardly anything to worry about.  If that's the only thing that goes wrong in 37K miles, that's pretty excellent in my book."
984,I'm sure since the product is in beta testing we shall see more numbers to come.
985,"Swinging back to the topic of shopping entry level performance cars (but not forgetting what we were knocking about), I personally don't pay too much attention to numbers when shopping for a car. As many car enthusiasts know, there is a ""car's numbers"" and there's ""how a car performs in the real world"", and those two things can be very different."
986,Here...Here!  So true.
987,"I look at 0-100 and 50-70 in-gear times to get a good idea of the overall power and flexibility of the drivetrain. That and responsive handling(with fairly high limits) are non-negotiable. I strongly prefer RWD and three pedals, although I can be persuaded by a decent DCT/DSG; ditto for AWD that actually"
988,"Consumers reports probably is the most representative of real world times.  They drive like normal people.  Light changes, hit the gas!"
989,"General question...Has anyone had to do any repairs on these cars lately.? Brakes, tires anything non-oil change related. Reason for the ask wondering when I will have to go for brakes and dreading the potential cost. Knock on wood 27k miles not a gremlin to be found- also 430 mile round trip recently almost did a round tripper at 27mpg without a stop but wussed out as the gas light came on with over 2 gallons left. Any Color appreshaited"
990,I'd bet you could get that done at a very good indie shop for under $1000.
991,"Agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the OEM warranty/""free"" service period expires."
992,"At my BMW dealer I get a 20%  discount on service as well as the parts and accessories I pick up for DIY projects. My Mazda dealer usually has a coupon I can use, and of course they also gave me free oil changes for as long as I own the car. I also have a few indie shops I can use that do excellent work."
993,Thank you community for the answers - much appreciated. I will look Indi as I have a service due in another 3500 miles or so. Has any Audi or s4 owner had to do brakes yet? Or BMW person ? If so mileage at time of service would be appreciated
994,"I could get you a quote from a California Audi shop, which of course will reflect our labor rates. I don't remember where you are residing, sorry."
995,He's in MA which most likely has high labor rates just like CA
996,"1995 318ti Club Sport: Front pads- 56,676 miles, F/R pads+rotors- 103,122 miles"
997,I've had two A6's have their brakes replaced and I have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's SQ5 and my S4.  She has over 50K on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new REAR brakes in less than 10K miles from now. Not sure what that means with respect to when the FRONT brakes would need replacing.
998,"They fed you a line; when my BMW dealer replaced the rear pads on my son's X3 at 132,214 miles I was told that the rear rotor thickness was within BMW specs and replacement was not required."
999,For ALL FOUR WHEELS?
1000,"Clarification -- new rotors were only required, so they said, if the pads were being replaced.  Can't imagine what other conditions besides a brake rotor and/or brake pad replacement are even possible.  The good news, they did it at no charge."
1001,Yep...
1002,"That just doesn't apply anymore, otherwise I am a poseur because I bought my 135i with the auto to get around the track faster."
1003,"That just doesn't apply anymore, otherwise I am a poseur because I bought my 135i with the auto to get around the track faster."
1004,"Taking it on a racetrack also counts as not ""wearing"" the car."
1005,"I wasn't agreeing about automatics in general, it was only with respect to 320i buyers. I'm always reminded of the idiot I met at my dealer's F30 intro party. Some of us were talking about the F30's potential track capability and one poor fool chimed in to say that he would"
1006,"I agree to a point, however, BMW offers factory performance upgrades, I'm sure BMS and others do the same thing these factory upgrades do, more boost, timing, fuel/air mixture."
1007,"The Sport Package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seats, and steering wheel (M Sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the M Sport Adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package. When it comes to leasing, a 328i with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. So the 328i over all is a better value."
1008,"But some people want to have it just the way it is - for them this mix of performance, reliability and gas mileage is just right, not some chipped stuff. Want more performance (power, suspension), less mileage, more wear (on tires, brakes) and lower factor of safety, got pay up, plain and simple."
1009,"Exactly...if you order mods from BMW, you are making a choice about what you are getting and what you might be giving up."
1010,"ANd people want more, so your point is?"
1011,"Count me in as one who modifies their cars and who has yet to find a down side(with the exception of my first car, where I added a cam with about ten degrees too much duration). My M6 received a Dinan chip while my Club Sport has a Turner/Conforti chip; it has over 140k on it. My MS3 makes over 60 hp more than stock via a Mazdaspeed intake and a Hypertech tune- and it has 157k on it."
1012,"You say that, but yor statement violates basic principles of engineering.  You essentially say you found a way to get something for nothing, no energy in, more energy out, by a wave of a wand.  I wish I could do it in structural design, but I can't."
1013,"My MS3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. At cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more spark advance dialed in."
1014,"But how about reliability, longevity?  Can you say with certainty, it's unchanged?  Noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque.  I suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences.  I just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude.  In nature, nothing is free.  You always pay somewhere.  Engineering is an act of balancing competing interests, as people have different interests, it will result in different products, but everything comes with a price."
1015,"Sure, it doesn't affect fuel economy...unless you actually use that extra power, at which point, why tune it at all? So, yes, it does increase fuel usage when you are utilizing those extra ponies. Nothing wrong with that."
1016,"I think that the engineers that design the car could tell you, on a statistical basis, what the likelihood is."
1017,"Well said.  There is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods.  However, the statistics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc."
1018,"I think it depends on the vehicle as well as the power increase that is sought. On my modified cars I have only pursued modest gains in horsepower/torque. Those gains might erode the reliability at the margin, but not to any significant extent. UOAs consistently indicate that the engines in my MS3 as well as my Club Sport are in excellent shape, so I'm not losing any sleep over the tweaks the cars have received."
1019,"I suspect the longevity of your cars relate much more to the high level of maintenance you give them then to the alleged benign nature of the modifications. Also I am sure you would agree that not all chips are engineered to a high standard, and that the consumer who is shopping price rather than reputation may end up with some rather bad results."
1020,"I believe BMW and for that matter most sport car manufactures have engineered their engines to perform with added stress and still be reliable, I asked this before and you and others haven't comments.. BMW markets the MPK and MPE for their cars, if it would cause added stress and lower reliability why would they make them and warrens them? Maybe they know the engines can take it?  Nah that can't be it."
1021,"You're missing my point entirely.  It's not if they can take it, it's which configuration is optimal for certain position in the market, considering all factors.  Apparently they believe factory configuration represents a better mix for the market.  You say they warrant those mods.  Just because it keeps the warranty, doesn't mean it's equally reliable.  Do you know what portion of that price is set aside for the warranty?  I don't. What I know are principles behind the engineering and they teach me nothing is free, everything is a tradeoff.  Small, or large."
1022,"Dino I'm sorry you can't grasp the idea that the extra HP from the chips haven't reduced reliability, even Roadrunner has stated he has no problems with 154K miles on a car.  All my motorcycles engine have modifications and have been stone reliable."
1023,"I don't think he missed the point. I think he's making another point. Maybe we could look at it this way. If it was simple and cheap to give a Mazda 3 some 60 more HP, why wouldn't Mazda just do that? It would give them a tremendous edge on the competition and would make the car the darling of the auto magazines. The Mazda engineers must have been weighing something other than cost in this decision. After all, Mazda could build those mods you made for a fraction of what it cost you."
1024,"heck, the BMW tune is ""free"" to BMW since they have the computer in there anyway.  So it seems like a no brainer to give the car all the extra power for the same price."
1025,"Because it is a limited warranty. It is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. They may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. Either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. If they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation."
1026,"Both the Mazdaspeed Intake as well as the Hypertech Sport Tuner have CARB approval. As to why Mazda didn't sell the car that way from the get-go? In the case of the intake I'd say probably it's due to the fact it uses a washable filter, is a bit louder, and requires a bit more effort to access the filter. As for the tune, Mazda actually did offer a tune on the Australian 3 MPS Extreme, which boosted power by 18 hp  and torque by 33 lb-ft."
1027,"So the numbers are in on the new BMW 340. BMS just Dynoed one, 331 to the wheels, it's quoted as making 320hp.. Now with the new Beta version of the BMS JB4 it makes 379hp at the wheel, that is with pump premium unleaded. a nice 48hp jump with a +3 lbs of boost.."
1028,"yeah, but.....dynos are not absolute numbers, they can be conjurer's tricks. I'd like to see results from say three independent dynos.  I can make a dyno give you any number you pick.  There are a number of videos on YouTube in which dyno claims are tested---some prove true, some miss the mark."
1029,well.  could be something interesting to consider in 2 years when my Sonata goes back!
1030,Flight nice color combo with the tints look sharp - how bout some shots of the boot
1031,"My dealer took in a 2012 135i M Sport(LeMans Blue/Alaska Gray) with most every option- including DCT- unfortunately. It is CPO, however and has only 12k miles on it. May yet look at it, but right now the '15 STI is still at the top of my list..."
1032,Not the first automaker to make a claim against BMW 3-series crown.  We'll see....................
1033,"More photo to follow. The 1 series just looked too odd to me, the 2 series I can live with"
1034,"And I prefer the 1 Series because I like a small vehicle. Saw one in blue that looked really nice but white really is the perfect color for this vehicle. Looks very sharp in white. Would truthfully like one of those after i trade the Golf down the road. Really is the perfect size for me and prefer a two door vehicle now. And by then, all the chicks will have flown the nest so affording one won't be an issue. Might as well enjoy ourselves in retirement and leave them all a little less!!"
1035,"The proportions of the 1er are a bit odd, but I find it to be an entertaining drive(DCT notwithstanding). The 2er is a nicely styled car, but so far I've been extremely underwhelmed behind the wheel."
1036,"I ordered a BMS stage 1 for Ricks 328i and it arrived Friday, even though I have been under the weather, I spent a whole 20 minutes installing it. It made a big difference with my 320, it really has made a HUGE difference in Ricks 328i. According to BMS the stage 1 increases 40 HP, and 50lbs of torque I do not doubt that."
1037,"FN, does it affect one's warranty?"
1038,Yes
1039,"It could if BMW would find the modification is the cause of the issue, however, the BMS makes less HP then the Dinan upgrade. I've had it on my car not for two years without problem, and so far I haven't read anyone having problems with it in their BMWs."
1040,"There's probably an effect over time, since there is more stress on components from both increased HP and no doubt, more aggressive driving, but maybe that just means a new X part at 80K rather than 100K. Seems like a low risk item, and BMW owners have confidence in Berger. Naturally, they sell this tune only for offroad use only and won't ship to California of course.  It would be interesting to measure how much ""dirtier"" your engine becomes.  They're basically messing with boost, timing and mixture, so it must affect emissions in some respects."
1041,Dinan get about 50 more HP and charge $1500... Steve Dinan stated that BMW engines are good to about 15% more HP without putting added stress on the engine. But their tune add's much more then 15%.
1042,"That sounds about right, and he should know.  No ""tune"" is for free, something has to be given away."
1043,"You mean I can't put 200 hp blower, race it every weekend and expect the engine and transmission last for million miles?  What an outrage"
1044,Steve's license is always hanging by a thread; I think he has taken every traffic school offered in California. Satch knows a few good stories about him...
1045,There is another Steve in Calif who builds cars for Ford and uses Fords engines in his cars that has a license issue.
1046,Well I am entitled to do that AND have BMW pay for the repairs.
1047,My son and I met Steve Saleen at a car show several years ago; a really nice guy- he autographed several posters and brochures for my son.
1048,I distinctly remember having this discussion before.
1049,"Brad you are missing the point, BMW knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added HP. I do not think the BMS stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. I have 38K miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. OF course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. I would assume that BMW, Audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra HP from them. If they don't, then they aren't being realistic."
1050,"There comes a time in the quest for HP when, if you want a faster car, you should go out and buy a faster car."
1051,"I made a mistake when I bought my 320i, I should have gotten a 328i. Listen learned... I almost pulled a trigger on a BMW Loaner, basically it was a fully loaded 328i, M Sport, Tech, DHP, Premium, Drivers Assistance package, heated seats. It only had 4K miles on it, MSRP was 52K, final sale price was $44K, but I would have had to roll about 9K into the deal, lease payments would have been about 576/m with zero out of pocket. decided not to do it. I'll tough it out until Oct 2017 when we a another ED. I like the M2, but I think it will  be small, I'm hoping that BMW will build a M4 Grand Coupe for 2018, if not then a 440i Grand Coupe it shall be, with the MPPK, and MPE, which makes more HP then the BMW stage 1."
1052,"Yes, before I put the BMS on Rick's 328, I did back to back rides, and even though the GT is heavier it felt faster. Now that the GT has the BMS, it is much faster then my 320i."
1053,Couple of things what is BMS? (My wife gets the other MS monthly)
1054,"Factory engineers have to compromise to give consumers a streetable package, decent MPG, good longevity, and a car that passes all emissions requirements. If they could just chip a car and give it a large HP boost over the competition, they would have done it. Obviously they didn't for some reasons related to the above parameters."
1055,"I think that a ""real enthusiast"" who isn't a horsepower junkie might buy a properly equipped 320i- but I'll concede that probably 99% of 320i buyers are ""lease to wear"" poseur/dweebs."
1056,count the pedals.  That will help weed them out.
1057,Standalone stores were the plan. Then that nasty little worldwide recession hit and they had to scale back. Nobody was interested in spending the money to launch a new luxury brand.
1058,"Remember, Mazda thought about doing this as well back in the 90's - brand was to be called ""Amati"". Would have included the Millenia and, I think, the 929."
1059,"I read the test report of the new Genesis 5.0 sedan in C&D, and, mostly, the report indicates the Genesis 5.0 Ultimate Super-duper bla bla bla could be considered to be a lot of car for the money (and the handling issues seem to have been largely erased, to boot) -- if it were a Mercedes E class. The issue is that certain less than impressive feeling of going into the dealership and seeing the $50K+ Genesis alongside some lesser model priced (via lipstick painted on the windshield [very"
1060,"I think that is one of the issues that Ford has with Lincoln.  A lot of Lincoln dealers are included with Ford dealerships and not stand alone.  The Ford dealers around here are pretty generic and don't provide that special atmosphere and experience that luxury buyers seek,"
1061,"My Jag/LR dealer was going through an upgrade when I purchased the XF.  But, as the XF hasn't given me any reason to return to the dealer, I've only been back once for the first, complimentary service about a year ago.  Man, I'm not getting my $ worth, in terms of free food offered at the dealer!"
1062,"Around here, they forced the Lincoln dealers to become standalone several years ago.  Plus, they closed some, too.  So, maybe closing some of their stores allowed the stand alones to harvest more customers and be able to make it on their own."
1063,Crossed 35K miles in the S4 and it still hasn't given me a good reason to go to the dealer for warranty service.
1064,"A reporter is looking to get in touch with car owners who are waiting for replacement parts, etc. for their faulty Takata air bags. If you're an affected owner and you'd like to help, please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by no later than Monday, November 9, 2015."
1065,"Same here -- the only thing, other than mntce, we've done is replace the OEM Grand Touring tires at 30K miles."
1066,I had read about that new system from Castrol on another forum.  It's a great idea but it will require the commitment from an automaker in order to get it started.  Who will be the first?
1067,"interesting.  but probably not as great as it may seem.  First of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption."
1068,"Our experience with Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. Tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal."
1069,"Correct.  Dry sump and the oil filter is integrated.  As for the underside inspections, that can still be done as part of a service."
1070,"Hey, they could also sell a follow-up oil analysis!"
1071,"that unit looks like it takes up a lot of space.   Seemed to be as big as a battery.  that is going to be a tough sell.  Sure, they free up room at the bottom of the engine, but that won't help with packaging under the hood!  Unless they put it on top of the engine, like the old Subaru's that had the spare tire there."
1072,"Hyundai just announced a new upscale brand, Genesis.  They say something like 4 or 5 models will be introduced.  Interesting.  Probably not right away, but if the brand sticks, I'm sure thy'l  bring one to ELLPS, it's going to be interesting how it will score."
1073,"It was simple, VW wanted to let buyers know that their cars are just as good as those other premium brands. Look at their product back then, the passt was really high end as far as fit and finish, and materials used, but it also was more expensive then the Camry's and Accords too. But we know that the upscale of VW failed and the bean counters got a hold of the cars, the new passt is nice, but no where as nice as the previous gen. The Golf feels upscale and some of the materials used is nicer then what one would get in Sentra or Corrola but those cars have more standard equipment then the Golf."
1074,"Rick would get calls from the Hyundai deal to come and trade in his Genesis and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how Hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement.  On one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a Kia dealer to look at the new (then) Cadenza, we both liked the car, it was room, the list of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the V6 Honda Accord line.Talking with the salesman we asked about the K900, he laughed and told  us that each Kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. But of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what Kia could be."" When it comes to Hyundai and the Genises and Equus I think you are going to see Hyundai move up scale with that brand. Both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken Hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those  here, and yes, Virginia they really do sell Equus. I'm thinking the accents cars are going away, and left for Kia to sell."
1075,"If the car is designed with it in mind, the space would be made.  I just opened the hood of my new Passat after owning it two days and there is a giant space available for something like it."
1076,"Wellllll . . .  the platform underpinning the Cayenne, Q7 and Touareg are shared.  The new Macaan shares about 1/3 of its foundation, so to speak, with the SQ5, but each company puts it own completely different finishing touches on their versions."
1077,"My blasted S4 has a leaky windshield washer fluid tank just discovered at 37,000 miles.  Begin the Audi bashing here......"
1078,At least the fluid tank will be replaced under warranty. Things happen.  Doesn't sound like this rises to the level of bashing.
1079,"No Audi bashing here yet... 27k miles, $300 oil change 5k miles ago my only real grip.  I get over 20 mpg in the city close to 30 on the highway would be a big deal if gas was $4 a gallon but still outstanding nonetheless givin this pup is pulling me at good speed most on ramps. Went 10 miles the last Sunday in 9 minutes including city driving - very proud of that given city I live in. Winter tires and rims now on the experience not as fun (or stylish) but I will be laughing at f150 owners once we get a decent snow storm- like we did every week last year."
1080,"So the big day finally arrived, 10 weeks after dropping it off in Pairs, Ricks car arrived at the dealership."
1081,Enjoy and have a blessed Thanksgiving to all!
1082,pretty car.  love the colors.
1083,FN....very cool!  Glad you finally got it home.
1084,Looks like Genesis will be the New Kid on this forum.
1085,"Honda is good on safety, but if I was forced to have a head on collision between the 320i and the Civic, I'd choose the 320i for my bones and body.  How about you?  Be honest."
1086,"How many miles have you racked up on the new S4?  There's been reports the engine really kicks it into gear once broken in at 1,000 and then again at 5,000 miles?"
1087,"3S has 184/185 HP/Torque.  so more HP than the 1.8T, a little less torque.  They are comparable performance wise I think.  Mazda might be a little quicker."
1088,"After nearly three dozen Audis since 1977, I can attest to the new engine feel that happens at 5K miles and at least once -- and my wife swears it is at least twice -- at a later mileage intervals. Indeed, my wife's SQ5 just turned 45K miles and her MPGs have climbed to over 27.  My S4 with 35K miles is closer to 29 MPGs -- and we're talking over the course of a 100 mile one-way drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds between 75 and 85 MPH."
1089,"I'd choose the BMW as well. But, my budget doesn't stretch that far, vehicle wise."
1090,"Since Mazda offers only the one engine, it's really unfair to compare that to the 3S engine."
1091,"They can and they have.. e.g. Cadillac and Lincoln.  Even Buick was considered a ""prestige"" brand until perhaps the mid 60s."
1092,"Rob, the 3S has the 2.5l engine with the 184/185 outputs.  Really a quick car since it is pretty light."
1093,"agreed Andy.  to me, the ""luxury"" brands were clearer in the old days.  Caddy for sure.  BMW was never luxury really. And Caddy really messed up the message when they tried to go real entry level (I guess the Cimmaron was the first attempt at an ELLPS?)"
1094,"Agreed but IMHO, it's not fair to compare the upgraded Audi motor to the base nee only Mazda motor.  If Mazda could shoehorn the 2.5 (184/185) in the 3, then it would be a fair comparison."
1095,"that motor is in the 3.  The 2.0 is in the 3i, and the 2.5 is in the 3s."
1096,"Argghhh.  My wittle head is so confused.  When you said 3S, I read it as S3.  I checked Mazda's website and they don't make it easy to find the 2.5 comes in the Mazda 3."
1097,"Geez, Mazda has been putting the 2.5 in the 3 for several years.  Same engine as in the bigger Mazda6 but it gets worse mpg.  Guess different gearing as it's the same tranny."
1098,"I'm around 3,700 miles now on the S4, so haven't hit that 5k mile mark.  To be honest, the car has felt real strong to me from the get go, so if it starts to ""kick it into gear"" at 5k miles, I suppose it'll be a pleasant surprise."
1099,"Geez, I guess I know I've gone through too many cars when I can speak to all these cars being discussed from personal ownership experience over the last year or so."
1100,"Mark, what was your first Audi?  While we were in France in 1975 my mom had a 71 100LS automatic.  It had in board front disc brakes that had to be replaced frequently, otherwise a good car. Mom really liked it.  Dad had a company car, a 75 Renault 30 with the PRV V-6.  That one stayed in the shop.  What Audi was your least favorite and your overall favorite?  You certainly have been loyal, going thru the dark period of unintended acceleration."
1101,"I got my first Audi in 1977, it was a '78 Audi 5000 with Power-pack (which just meant it had power brakes, steering, locks, windows, antenna.  I think the sunroof was crank.)"
1102,HA - I had a 1978 Audi Fox GTI.
1103,Lux sales ytd. It's close.
1104,"I know one thing, the wife's A3 and my Golf both have the 1.8T engine but hers just seems to drive smoother. Think hers is heavier and maybe that's the reason why. While hers calls for premium, mine wants regular. And her first oil change was at 5K while mine was at 10K. I do know her interior looks and feels a bit nicer than mine. Being our first time going German, these are just my initial reactions to what I see and feel. Maybe next time I'll try a BMW just to see but hope they still make a small vehicle like the 1 Series by then."
1105,"good banter here of late ... I am still an manual purist but I agree with Mark the transmission tied to the engine of the s4 is pretty perfect. It shifts so quick, is so veristile being a gentlemens salon to a sports sedan in a second and can get 30mpg on the highway- in fact as my s4 gets older (25k miles) it gets 20-22 in the city. Compared to my g35x it's night and day as I was getting city figures on the highway- and I loved that car. On the awd weight issue thing... With the optional limited slip diff you could never guess when pressing car into turns that its awd and weighs as much as a whale. I love the car. I can't wait to drive an s3 because for me it has everything I would need and would love to see how it compairs."
1106,"Sandy, in theory it is not the same engine.  mostly the same, but Audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium.  But, more likely it is just that the Audi has more sound insulation or some such.  Check the specs on the 2 cars.  see if output is any different (peak HP/torque, at what RPM).  if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!"
1107,"It was noted that during a recent ""downturn"" in the business cycle, your posts dried up to a mere trickle.  Some were even short."
1108,"Mark....once again, good observations."
1109,"I am very much looking forward to the ""brand"" Genesis.  I think this move could poke and prod the Germans and the Japanese (and I hope the Americans) to provide even more in the way of features, functions, reliability and durability, and of course, performance."
1110,"The problem is that Hyundai won't be putting the ""Genesis"" brand into their own stores. It will be more like Scion - a corner of an existing Hyundai store. Not sure if they are forcing the dealers to upgrade their facilities if they want to carry the 'brand', either."
1111,"One word should be at the top of ""the memo"" to [US] Genesis store owners:"
1112,Exactly.
1113,"Still can't fathom the giant mistake by Hyundai in not taking a page from the Lexus/Infiniti/Acura playbook.  You cannot sell a true luxury car alongside mainstream cars.  If they want to be taken seriously by luxury buyers, they have to establish separate Genesis brand and dealers.  Should have done it from the start."
1114,"It's all about branding.  You're right, they don't make economy class Rolexes.  Auto makers should not be diluting the quality of their brands by cheapening them.  Want a cheaper Audi?  Buy a Volkswagen."
1115,"I'd love to get my '06 A3 back for a day and show you all just how many itty bitty little cost cuts Audi made to the current A3/S3 model generation.  I still think, however, that Audi is doing well because they do the least amount of ""cost cutting,"" of any brand."
1116,"Not sure I buy that if there's no real luxury there. I drove a Mercedes A-class in Europe a few years ago. If they decided to bring that car here, would that automatically make it EELPS? Not in my book - no luxury (and not much performance) at all."
1117,"Is it really??? Have you owned one?  I would put the Genesis sedan against the 5 series and E class, same size, just as quite is not quieter, ride is supple, standard equipment is greater then both of the Germans, just because it's built in Korea doesn't mean it's not a luxury car. In fact no one answer my question, when it comes to price, and which price we going to use to determine if the car is a luxury car.  You think car maker determines this."
1118,"Well, I may end up in another BMW yet. I posted this over in CCBA as well..."
1119,never say never.
1120,"I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example:  Tissot makes/markets watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches.  These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces."
1121,"At the end of the day, that Genesis owner still has to tell his friends he drives a Hyundai."
1122,"Yes, he does.  And his friends who know which end is up, will know that he is a very savvy car buyer.  Those who are status conscious, those who have to own a Rolex and drive a BMW just for the status, will look down their noses at him."
1123,"Rolex does make a cheaper watch - it's branded as a Tudor.  Instead of a Rolex movement, it has a movement made by ETA, which makes movements for a lot of watchmakers including Tag, Movado, and Tissot.  Rolex didn't want to ""sully"" the Rolex name but still wanted a piece of the medium price watch market."
1124,"Interesting comment, having one in the family people are hard pressed to believe that Hyundai built the car. For people like yourself, the badge on the hood makes the car."
1125,Your ARE what you
1126,"My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it.  For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature.  The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX.  No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us)."
1127,"Guess I prefer to drive what I like now...and can afford! Before I retired the first time, had to drive econoboxes due to finances and family situation...raising our kids. Now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the CUV route back in December of 2013 and bought a mid-line Hyundai Tucson. Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good."
1128,"For most of us here, I assume, we really don't care what other folks think, within reason of course.  If you like the Audi, BMW or Mercedes BRAND, you like the brand, other's opinions are of tertiary importance."
1129,"Funny, that's also what I see with TRD. I wouldn't pick that! (not that I want a pickup anyway)."
1130,"Even though I traded in my Mazda3 for the S4, I will whole-heartedly agree on your comments on the 3 being a ""cheap car that feels nice.""  Mine was the Grand Touring model with the appearance package, and at $26k, it was (and is) an excellent car.  Great driving dynamics, adequate power, and a better infotainment system than my Audi."
1131,"I came real close on the Mazda 3.  Just did not quite work out.  But I did think you could have rebadged it as an entry level Audi, with little or no changes, and people would have fawned all over it."
1132,"Agreed, the current Mazda 3 lifted the bar for its segment considerably- especially with respect to the interior."
1133,"I've said it before and I'll say it again- in today's market the term ""luxury car"" is meaningless.  Back in the day if a car had power windows/ locks and air conditioning it was considered a luxury car but now almost every car has those things as well as many other entertainment and comfort features."
1134,"well, I don't know about the term itself, but I feel there is definitely a big difference between a true luxury car and a mundane car loaded with options. No matter how many gadgets you throw on a Civic, it is still a Civic, and it won't compare to a 3-series in the end."
1135,"Not to throw gas on the fire - but, why?"
1136,"I've tried to convince myself a ""lesser"" car is good enough. It just isn't. I did that when I leased an '06 Accord EXL V6. Figured ""hey, it has everything in it."" It only took a few months before the road noise, quality of materials, seat comfort, etc, got on my nerves."
1137,"I don't think ""luxury"" is about gadgets but about the quality of materials....and yes...the badge on the grille does matter, as does the MSRP to some extent.  I know this doesn't speak too well of human perceptions vs. reality, but remember that experiment where the people dressed in white lab coats seemed more ""believable"" to participants than the people dressed in ordinary street clothes, even though both were saying the same thing?"
1138,"Well, if mainstream brands can't go ""up"", can Luxo brands go down?   Thinking of the MB CLA and upcoming BMW (1 series?). The FWD models trying to cover the bottom end.  Did the descend into Acura territory?  Has the civic touring elevated to that?"
1139,"We are in agreement. The badge does add some cost, but there is some justification behind it, such as materials, build tolerances, engineering."
1140,"What kind of HP does the Mazda 3 offer in top trim (no Speed 3 is available last I checked?  Although described as adequate, I have a feeling even the 1.8T from VW/Audi would leave it in the dust?"
1141,"What kind of HP does the Mazda 3 offer in top trim (no Speed 3 is available last I checked?  Although described as adequate, I have a feeling even the 1.8T from VW/Audi would leave it in the dust?"
1142,"Honda is good on safety, but if I was forced to have a head on collision between the 320i and the Civic, I'd choose the 320i for my bones and body.  How about you?  Be honest."
1143,"Mark, I like your A7 review..thanks.  My problem with it is that it is verrry low to the ground making egress especially interesting for some."
1144,"Well ... yes and no.  I just purchased a new ""Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer)"".  I opted for the new for this year twin-turbo 2.7L engine, which is entirely unproven.  (As to longevity, I mean.)  If I had planned to keep the truck ""until the wheels turn square"", most likely would have opted for the old school V8 engine.  With this particular engine (the twin turbo), if I were to decide to keep it past end of warranty, I will most likely spring for the extended factory warranty BEFORE the base warranty expires."
1145,"I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early).  I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change.  Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is.  If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound.  Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp."
1146,So why not follow manufacture recommended service? What do you know that others don't?
1147,"Mark in regards to the A7, I think it's one of Audi's better designed cars, I would love to have one myself. But not too sure what packages I would want on it, sport package would high on the list."
1148,"It's a bit like apples and oranges, but I have over 20 UOAs on my MS3 and they indicate that M1 5W-30 is good for at least 10k miles in that application, and note that DI turbos are supposed to be particularly hard on oil. And M1 0W-40 is fine for 10k miles in the M54 in my son's X3."
1149,"Both my wife and I have the Audi Advantage Pre-paid program; however, we have an oil and filter (and check up overall) performed EVERY 5,000 miles, meaning we pay for every other interval and the odd intervals are paid for as part of the Audi Advantage."
1150,"Have you had a UOA performed at 5,000 miles? If not, how do you know that changing the oil at that mileage provides ""insurance""?"
1151,OMG -- Fact-based analysis.  What's the world coming to?
1152,I know what not one but two highly trusted mechanic's/shop manager's said.
1153,didn't the BMW service intervals jump right when they started paying for the service?  I'm sure it was pure coincidence!
1154,"I guess you can't know for sure, but what line in the sand results from a UOA would you use?  Some people might draw their line in the sand more stringently, and of course, driving conditions and habits can change any individual's results, even with the same car and oil."
1155,"BMW uses synthetic oil, and the study's shows that synthetic oil last longer so why change the oil when not necessary."
1156,"Well, still hard to imagine that 14-15K is good, but could be."
1157,"They have the ""condition based"" service, which is capped at 1 year.  They lowered the mileage cap to 12k, I think.  Condition based service is calculated by the computer based on driving severity.  The only thing it doesn't take into account is environment.  They don't have oil sensors (I don't think anybody does), so if it gets dusty or contaminated, you wouldn't know it."
1158,Dino I think the computer can take into account max temp.. My service intervals are less during summer months
1159,"Here's my statement:  I change the oil, at the dealer, every 5,000 miles.  For all I know it is a waste of money, not any real ""insurance"" whatsoever. The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities.  My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil.  We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil."
1160,"If the TBN is over 1.5 and wear metals(aluminum, copper, iron, lead) are tracking within about 25% of universal averages(adjusted for mileage) I would think that your oil is probably being changed too early. Aside from the break in period and the variable valve timing actuator TSB the UOAs from my MS3 have been remarkably consistent- even when the car has seen the track."
1161,"Any issues with needed sludge and carbon deposits/build-up cleaned?  Injector, induction, and other cleanings?  I know my A3 seemed much more lively after one of these services, but it was no Jiffy Lube job, it was a serious induction system cleaning."
1162,"I run a bottle of Techron through the MS3 every 3k miles; no other ""cleanings."" In-gear acceleration times have remained consistent since 40k miles so I don't see a need for any other treatments."
1163,"roadburner - We have become true believers in using only Top-Tier gasolines -- and now that Costco participates in that designation (and we have two Costco fuel locations fairly close to home), even the prices for TTG aren't shocking anymore."
1164,Yes; I've use Top Tier fuel in everything save the Jeep for years.
1165,"When I sat in the A3 sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). My 1998 A4 was about the same size as the current A3 sedan but the older A4 was a much nicer car inside."
1166,It should be simple.  Entry level luxury is the lowest priced models of  luxury makes.
1167,Priced as MSRP or payments?  Just saw an ad here in Phoenix for a 2015 Hyundai Geneses sedan for $299/m or BMW 320i for $259/m
1168,"Genesis, nice as it may be, is really stretching the definition since Hyundai is not a luxury make.  3-series is clearly entry-level luxury."
1169,"Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house.  Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium."
1170,"Sometimes the problem is that image is just tarnished. They're making pretty good cars, but the name says Old People Boats. Hard to shake that. And of course the franchise agreements the dealers have with GM pretty much constrain much flexiblity for GM. I would have said close down Caddy and start a differently-named luxury division, but probably not practical."
1171,""""
1172,Still would rather the Q50 over the ATS/CTS. But that's probable just me!
1173,I like the Q50 & I've even warmed up to the TLX in its V6 SH-AWD trim.  Both cars offer tremendous bang for the buck which is very important in this category.
1174,"I love the TLX, but in FWD 4 cyl form.  great transmission."
1175,"The $10-15K extra for the Golf R is worth it as compared to the GTI.  As someone who threw thousands into a former A3, I should know.  You get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning.  Most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your Golf R safely to 350 HP +/- for very little money.  Whereas running 300 or more HP on a regular GTI by matching the turbo in the Golf R works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability.  Also, the R is 3rd generation Haldex AWD."
1176,"I guess it all comes down to if you find the current generation GOLF an econobox or not.  I found it to be quite well detailed and trimmed inside and out.  The chassis is strong, tight, and light.  All good things.  I haven't test driven the Golf R yet; that's the next step.  I'd bet money the rare flaws I found in the Mexican built Golfs/Sportwagens is non-existent in the German built R.  Another big-time PLUS for the R in my book vs. other Golf's.  That alone makes it not just ""another"" Golf to me."
1177,Here's another issue that Cadillac faces:  The Auto Mall (AM).
1178,"I'm obviously in the ""undervalued"" camp. Although I did get a significant discount on my CTS, which pushed the decision very far in Caddy's favor, I did compare to BMW and Jag (never made it to the Benz dealer) and, since I value performance, preferred the Caddy. Even if it was the same cost, I would have thought the CTS the better car, although it is possible the steeper depreciation would have swayed me if not for the discount."
1179,"Never been a big fan of Caddy's styling, but I always looked at a previous CTS Wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative.  Graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either.  I'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if I wanted something else.  E-class wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time.  Don'd care much for cladding on the Allroad.  I may check out V60, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""R"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - I may look at S60-R as a proxy).  All others dropped out."
1180,"I think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of Caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, I haven't checked). Since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make Caddy MORE expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? Or is GM basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
1181,"Make no mistake, the other luxo models depreciate steeply, too. I've lost about $13k-$14k on my CTS in the first year of ownership (only that low thanks to discount). A comparable 550i is down roughly $20k (assuming I could have gotten about $5k off, which I'm totally guessing at). They have to heavily subsidize their leases, too."
1182,"I don't have any Cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say."
1183,"Which puts you at about $1100 or $1200 a month, just in depreciation.  Ouch!!!"
1184,"Was that Mustang GT brand new?  Hard to believe there wasn't depreciation on a ""new"" car."
1185,Mustang was new. It was about $4k over 18 mos.
1186,Well GC got a hell of a discount on his CTS too. Best deal doesn't always mean best car.
1187,"BNW has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that BMW over inflates their residual on the leases.  But if you take a M3 and ATS V-Sport I'm sure the BMW will have a higher sale value, the same could  be said with the M5 and CTS V Sport."
1188,"Like I said, I got what I thought was the best car for me... I just happened to get the best deal on it, too."
1189,"If you want to play with the big boys, you better bring your check book!  (smile)"
1190,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented.  The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome."
1191,"I suspect that's true in many cases - business deductions, or if you buy every 3 years or maybe even every 5."
1192,"I don't suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome, I buy cars I really like and hold on to them. 20 years in the case of the Club Sport, 13 years in the case of the Wrangler, and 8 years in the case of the MS3. That said, I've still owned 20 cars over my 42 years of driving. For my current 5 car fleet I budget $425 per month for maintenance and repairs- I guess that's really stupid- I should probably just lease 3 cars and make payments of upwards of $2100 month; that way I'd certainly save money."
1193,"Hmmm.  In my 47 years of driving cars (only motorcycles until I was 20) I've had 7 that accumulated ~850K miles, with my 240Z's 224K miles the highest.  So, there are three of us that do this sort of thing on here anyway.  I'm not counting the 200K I put on my '71 KW, but those two years I was driving my car a lot less."
1194,"My '15 Golf SE doe not have power start and after having it in a loaner, would really have liked to have it. Not sure what 2016 will show, but doubt they'll add it. Thinking one day all vehicles will have power start and keys will no longer be necessary."
1195,"When you say ""power start"" do you mean ""Remote Start"" since all cars have power start..  BMW does not offer remote start on the 3,4 or 5 series cars, which is ashame living here in the desert, it is nice to be able to start your car before getting into to cool it off.."
1196,Maybe Sandy means keyless start.
1197,"Yes, no button on the console like the Jetta I drove had...just pushed the button and the car started up. At first I didn't like it but after a couple of days, I loved it! Would be so much easier to not have to deal with a key at all!"
1198,"$37k? ouch! It is still a Focus, after all."
1199,"I'd pay $37k, but not what the dealers will ask. 345 hp, torque vectoring, Drift Mode- certainly some of the most fun you can have under $5k- never mind $37k. I'd consider one if I didn't want a truly fast RWD track toy."
1200,"I don't think I could do it. Once a car breaks that $30k barrier, I can no longer justify an econobox, no matter how capable. A Charger RT is cheaper, and a Scat Pack is only marginally more."
1201,Golf R is $38K but it's still a Golf.
1202,I class them as subcompact econoboxes and compact econoboxes.
1203,Whatever I get it will be something that I can actually say is fast with a straight face- a 0-100 in around ten seconds or less qualifies. My new sled also has to have fairly decent track capability- if it can lap VIR in 3:05 seconds or so it merits consideration.
1204,"For the price nothing will be as fast, one of the  better bang for the bucks cars out there."
1205,"I'll be curious to see how it does vs the Mustang. The weight advantage and AWD would indicate it should be better in the twisties. Ford's 0-60 estimate is 4.7 secs, mustang is 4.5, and scat pack is 4.4. Top speed of the Focus and Stang are both 164 vs the Scat Pack's 176. Honestly, the Focus is going to have to dominate on the track, IMHO, to overcome its small cheap car roots for that pricetag."
1206,"Hey Graphic one of your computers has a virus, just got a spam e-mail from you on your Yahoo account..."
1207,Really?  Hmmmmm......did it come from graphicguy?
1208,"I'd consider the Charger an econobox, just a larger one."
1209,"it came from graphicguy@satake7.com  It had my email address, so I can only assume it is a virus, and the e-mail account is a fake. Here is the URL they want to click on.."
1210,"This is probably not a virus.  The spammers scan for names on the internet (facebook, et. al) and then fake those names into those phoney return emails.  I have received several emails from my ""sister"" - essentially correct first and last name, fake return email and link in English with something like ""this is cool"".  Well, she doesn't speak English and even if she did, she wouldn't send me an email in English."
1211,"""I'd consider the Charger an econobox, just a larger one. """
1212,"Be gentle; he was sexually abused by a Neon decades ago, but the memories are still painful."
1213,Well not too sure how the spammer got my e-mail address....
1214,"If you have an e-mail address, a spammer has it."
1215,"LOL  through tears.  Unfortunately, true.  Spammers either scan for the addresses, or use aggregator programs that compound email addresses.  I have a rare name and don't get as many spam email, as say Joe Smith would get.  For several years I was getting almost nothing, but the spammers finally cracked the code of my email address.  I think it's probably due to proliferation and some public domain databases, like e.g. my professional license data, or similar."
1216,"Either that.... or, they got hold of his address book, once before..     And, even after his account has been secured, they keep spamming out emails to those addresses.     Happened to me.."
1217,$37k focus - as mentioned the golf r similar car - the subi sti ain't cheap and if you ever been in  / driven one it's amazing track car but it's not a sudo lux csr. . Ford bringing this over is cool - prob won't sell many but it's great to see they are making the effort to excite.
1218,"It will be similar to daily driving a Hellcat, GT350R, ZL1, R32, STi et al.  The difference is the Focus and the latter two shows what can be done with less than 3 liters of turbocharged fury."
1219,"I don't think I could have lived with an STi or EVO as a daily driver, so maybe this car has to be categorized as a wonderful toy to own in addition to something else.  I suppose by year 2000 standards it might qualify as somewhat ""luxury"" but I doubt it would meet today's competition in that area."
1220,"I had 2008 STI, it was quite easy to live with and had enough amenities, as long as your lifestyle didn't ""require"" E-class level.  I commuted with it for three years - a bit noisy, but generally easy to drive, steer, not too harsh (for me) on the back.  As long as you understood what you had, it was fine.  I traded for my current 328i, because that's what I wanted - a finer, nicer automobile, with some more ""stuff"", even if (quite a bit) slower."
1221,"Not me FN.  Not sure what to do.  Not my email address, and no one else has reported anything to me."
1222,Well BMW just released the info on the all new M2.. 370hp 369lbs of torque.. Just waiting for the price. Now if only BMW would build a M4GC...
1223,I hope that the timing chain in Munich's B58 motor lasts as least as long as the clutch- it's located at the
1224,I'd love to listen to some German engineer explain that one....unless of course it's like what Saab did---put the entire motor in backwards.
1225,"Love how this thread has gotten better as flight now reads the""rags"" for the new reads- nice, keep it up - love the m2 really cool - rare muscle thats almost as quick around some German track I'll never drive as an m3/4 but let's hope the price starts in mide 50's not 60."
1226,"A bit cruel, that article...it implies that the general public views the Cadillac CTS on the same status level as the Hyundai Genesis.   I think the author is correct, but it's a bitter pill for GM I'm sure."
1227,"Oh well, I'll probably never even take"
1228,BMW reduces ED discount from 7% to 5%.
1229,The ED MSRP and Invoice is 7% and will be 5% less than the normal MSRP and Invoice price.  It is possible to negotiate a better ED price on a BMW than the official prices as there is some profit left for the dealer.
1230,Small additions/corrections:
1231,"If flying to DC in gross polluting high NOX emission jet planes begging for bailouts for failed business enterprises didn't hurt the Big 3's reputation much, certainly tricking the EPA won't hurt much either other than fines that go into somebodies pocket."
1232,"Neither.  The price is simply negotiated same way as it were US delivery, with ""ED MSRP"" and ""ED Invoice"" values being"
1233,"Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower."
1234,"Which taxes?  Surely not my sales tax.  Florida taxes new and used car sales the same, anyway, I think.  Perhaps you are thinking of US custom tariff, which if true, would make sense.  I have no idea what tariffs are on vehicles, as they are generally included in the price of the product and not itemized the same way say state sales taxes are."
1235,"My understanding isn't that the import taxes are that much less on a used car,  Rather, ED cars do not have holdback on them, don't qualify for dealer incentives or bonus money, and the US subsidiary profit is wiped away since they didn't sell the car.  Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
1236,"Someone said the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built.  From the time I had purchased my 5th or 6th Audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars.  He shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit.  He said he wished US customers were more like European customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders."
1237,"I agree that your friend store owner would rather his business model changed, if he could, and sell cars from a book.  However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories.  So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity.  The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock."
1238,"Many people still buy cars because they have to get one right away.  Accident, old one died, etc.  so has to be some amount of inventory."
1239,No BMW dealer I've dealt with has
1240,"Ain't it the truth regarding the limited colors available -- and, at the risk of being creamed here -- why do all these high-buck German cars always seem to have black interiors?  I ONCE got a black interior (and that was in an Acura TL) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that I would walk out rather than have a black interior car.  I got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- I get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty."
1241,"Because that is what sells. Now this according to a couple of Client advisers I have spoken with. For BMW black interior is the color of choice, I don't get it, since it makes the interior of a 3 series look small."
1242,"I have black interior and I like it.  Saddle brown is pretty good, too.  But I've seen a lot of white and beige around here. Now - the higher level models, like 7-series probably do have more black interiors than anything."
1243,"After having black leather in my Accord, I said never again.  too hot, and dreary."
1244,"Agree, I don't like black. Only car we've ever had with black interior is our Mazda 5 and the black carpet shows every bit of dust and particles."
1245,I like black.
1246,"I've always liked a white car with a coral red, chestnut, or saddle leather interior.  I agree, it has to have the dark carpeting.  White or silver cars with black interiors, to me, are lack-luster."
1247,"Same here, my wife's 2009 E90 has a full beige interior and the carpets and seats show the tiniest speck of dirt. It doesn't help that the more recent BMW interiors don't age all that well; the interiors of my 2007 MS3(156k miles) and 1995 E36(142k miles) show much less wear."
1248,"When I do my ED in 2017, my 440i Grand Coupe will be Mineral Grey with Coral Interior."
1249,"I will have Melbourne Red 440i GC with either black/red stitch or saddle brown.  Don't know yet. Very strange, but BMW just restricted the red from M-Sports package just on the 4-series (you can have it with 3).  I don't really get it.  I like that package for the shadowline trim (black door frames), but I'd likely let it go, as I still rather have the red."
1250,"Hey Dino what is the draw of the M Sport?   Currently I'm just looking at a 440i, Track Package, Driver Assistance package, Tech package.  The Track Package has the M Adaptive Suspension and for $1700 it's a steal."
1251,"I basically like the black exterior treatment aesthetics of tha package vs. standard chrome treatments.  That's what I have now., by the way, but back then it was packaged differently.  I liked the old Le Mans Blue, no longer available.  Estoril grew on me a little, but I didn't like it at first.  Now it is my second choice, Imperial Blue close third.  Very close, more like depends on the time of the day."
1252,I wish we could have gotten Mediterranean blue.
1253,"It's the new one, only on sedan and wagon so far.  It is nice, indeed."
1254,"The black interior of our white gloss A3 just seems to fit the size of the vehicle. On my blue Golf, got the ivory interior and so glad I did because in the hot South Florida, black is just too hot for me. When I had a loaner Jetta with the black inside, I just knew I made the right decision. The wife has not complained about her A3's black guts and I don't ask. In the A3, don't think the ivory inside would look very nice, black just seems to work. The Audi has been flawless though the Golf has had a few teething issues but now, all has quieted down as I rack up the miles."
1255,"Now for something completely different, Ford Focus RS, new HP figured have been released, 350hp and 350 lbs of torque. Starting price $37K, but knowing Ford Dealers they will be asking for 10 over MSRP..  Now, I found a video of what it sounds like, I wonder if this is what the US bound RS sounds like."
1256,Unless they don't.
1257,Unless they don't.
1258,I don't think they did it to save a few hundred dollars per car.
1259,"Agree.  Look at the other compliant (as far as we know, anyway) diesels - mileage margins against their gas counterparts is diminishing, the durability is basically gone, the robustness is gone (they are very sensitive to fuel quality).  I'm more and more convinced European diesel explosion was a huge con perpetuated by the officials and manufacturers on the people to lower CO2 with all other more harmful stuff ignored.  Euro VI standards are just catching up with EPA and they will wake up to the new reality that diesel doesn't look so great anymore."
1260,And the scandal deepens....From Automotive News
1261,"Audi R & D Chief's very name, ""Hackenberg,"" seems almost like a random and unintentionally comic spin on how they ""hacked"" their own software....But it seems like the higher execs are going to do a Colonel Klink."
1262,"Apparently now BMW is under scrutiny.  No evidence, just suggestions or some early reports, media are often wrong at first.  However, if true we can say with near certainty that all become suspects.  The Europeans better look closely at Peugeot, Renault, Fiat et al."
1263,"One of the key comments -- and one that I agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished.  The thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?"
1264,"Seems like the EPA ought to have a testing process where the equipment rides in the car and sniffs the tailpipes while driving. I'd want to know that ALL cars had been checked for cheating - gas, diesel, the works."
1265,"Not seeing this VW/Audi/Porsche dieslmthung going awaynany time soon.  Current diesel customers won't like the fix.  They'll want some sort of compensation for not getting what ghey thought they were buying.  Potential future customers crossing the brands off their ""buy"" list."
1266,"Exactly; look how long it took Audi to get out from under the so-called ""unintended acceleration"" scandal. Decades can be spent building brand equity but it can be destroyed in the blink of an eye."
1267,from Auto News:
1268,Oops
1269,"This -- VW/diesel-gate -- ought to be a lesson, but I find it difficult to believe it will be, other than the fact that in Germany CORPORATIONS aren't indicted, INDIVIDUALS are."
1270,"Winterkorn walked away with a Golden Parachute to the tune of $67 million.  If that's what you call ""being screwed"", then I really, really want to volunteer to be ""screwed""."
1271,"Bill Maher offers parodies of VW ads halfway through this 2 minute video. Could Audi ""Truth in Engineering"" parodies be next?"
1272,I think VW and Audi will survive. But one estimate said this might cost $50 billion or so worldwide when all is said and done. Look at this this way—you'll probably get your next Audi for slightly less than you thought.
1273,"I just hope they'll try harder, like they have something to prove.  Because they do, of course.  I also hope this will spark more competition, as when they try harder, others will have ro respond."
1274,"When the Lincoln LS was introduced most Lincoln dealers were pimping them out; there was one Lincoln manager who would come to Edmunds as well as other boards and ask for the names of the dealers that were cranking out the Drug Dealer/Blue Hair Specials. Unfortunately, the auto dealer franchise laws make it well-nigh impossible to yank a franchise absent criminal conduct- so dealers with no taste will continue to perpetrate these abominations on the driving public."
1275,I saw one of those full vinyl roof CTS's last week too.  Actually looked OK on that car (dark red with black roof).  But I don't recall any gold bling on it.
1276,Supply meeting demand.   Give the customer what they want.
1277,"Mark....I think the Cadillac dealers (and I'm quite familiar with the exact one you're talking about) are themselves trying to find a way out of the sales ""funk"" Cadillac is in.  If it takes luring Octogenrians back into the showroom (which Cadillac is trying so hard to expel) to make money, they will."
1278,For anyone here who might be considering European Delivery on a BMW:
1279,Disapointing.
1280,"Heck, I saw a new Camry a couple of weeks ago with the landau treatment. No idea why such a thing is still even possible on cars."
1281,I've seen an MB and Audi with the landau treatment.  Money doesn't buy taste.
1282,"Non-sensical, but a little funny."
1283,"Not that strange.  My taxes pay the EPA's bureaucracy, ineffectiveness, and waste."
1284,"As this VW fiasco evolves, I stop feeling strange seeing the amount of people who would view things solely from their personal interest, while disregard the goodness of others, the general public, and the necessity of things that keep the society in order.  I guess a strong faith to Adam Smith is needed.  That said, the integrity of most people in this forum is quite commendable."
1285,"I've been reading and watching the TV biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff.  The current news is that this is a re-run; Cadillac did it (got fined) Ford did it, etc.  Apparently 11M (VW's numbers) vehicles had this software installed.  Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing."
1286,"According to an article I read somewhere, but can't find right now, someone with familiarity with emissions systems said it would have probably cost VW only $200-300 more per car to make them actually pass the test. Almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales, but it could have been done."
1287,"well, obviously they could make the cars pass the test.  For no extra money, because they did pass the tests."
1288,"Say what?  Did he really just say that?  ""Without the EPA, ... emissions would be about the same..."""
1289,"Relax.  If GM killed 124 people from criminal coverups and only 13 people were fired, VW has no worries, imho.  We did the same thing in the '70's defeating the archaic smog devices to get the HP's up!"
1290,"what might save VW (at least in the US) is that the issue is specific to the Diesel.  Most sales are gas, so maybe those people don't bail?"
1291,"I am sitting here watching a TV show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims.  The ""expert"" (I have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 PER CAR.  I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much."
1292,"The BMW diesel X5 tested by the same company passed with flying colors. Much more expensive car, obviously."
1293,"Most States have adopted CARB standards, so yes, emissions would be about the same without the EPA.  Also, while the EPA might have stringent emission criteria, their tests are obviously incompetent to detect actual emissions, so actual emissions would be about the same, while perhaps the regulations might have lower standards.  I'm talking real-world here."
1294,"""Most states"" would mean more than half, which would mean more than 25 states. In fact, it's fewer than 20 states according to wikipedia:"
1295,The X5 is an ad-blue version -- I believe the ones that were fudged were the little bitty engines that were claimed to NOT NEED ad-blue.
1296,"I think the issue with AdBlue is that you need to keep putting this stuff in, so the there is more maintenance, which defeats ""economy"" car proposition."
1297,What kind of additional costs are we talking about for ad-blue annually? (at the 2.0L engine size).
1298,"My guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. It seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp."
1299,"I'm still confused at to why the fix costs anything. Just flash the code to stay in test taking trim, and there you go.  Mpg and performance, well that will be whatever it is."
1300,VW tried a software fix. Didn't work. Check the diesel thread.
1301,"Perhaps when you reflash, the car becomes undriveable.  It may not be just simple loss of power and gas mileage, but such strange output characteristics that it is no longer streetworthy.  When car is on rollers, it doesn't push anything.  Just guessing here."
1302,"Being the owners of a 2015 Audi A3 and a VW Golf SE, both gas models, think this will all blow over and VW/Audi will survive just fine. Seems that all, or most, car companies have had their share of problems over the years, some worse than others, but most have survived and thrived in later years. We're not worried one bit, as we keep our vehicles longer than the average owner does, and look forward to many years of fun driving ahead. If had to do it all again, the only change I think I'd make is I'd have also bought an A3, in a different color though. Since the wife had a bigger budget than I, the Golf seemed to be the next best alternative to a similar vehicle since one seems to be built upon the other."
1303,"I won't be so optimistic. Even though the damage it causes (more air pollution) doesn't seem so serious, the cost and fine for recalling 11M cars doesn't seem out of hand for a company this size, the lost trust might be repaired overtime... the law suits from owners and governments around the world can really bring VW to its knees. It's one thing to build a lousy car or falsify the HP or MPG, another to intentionally cheat. One of the above can be criminally charged."
1304,"Honestly I'd like to see companies that are blatant cheaters to go down HARD. Unfortunately it doesn't usually happen. The big US banks are all bigger than ever and ready to cause a new economic destruction. I'm sure VW won't be hit all that hard. I used to like VW, had VWs for many years, but the combination of parts costs, crappy dealer service, decontented blandmobiles, and now severe cheating is enough for me to never touch them again."
1305,Isn't $35K the possible fine/penalty per car?
1306,"Well, then, if you are correct and it seems logical that you are -- I still don't understand why VW would risk so much for a couple hundred or so bucks increase in the MSRP. Also, the total US number of cars affected is just south of 500K, globally it is 11M.  If VW just thought the US EPA was BS, why cheat on the other 10.5M cars?"
1307,"Most of the gas station we saw in Europe had a special pump to add ""the Blue."" But we all know that Europe has adapted oil burners and that 90% of cars are oil burners.."
1308,Not even close to 90  percent.
1309,Perhaps wishing will make it so.
1310,"My son is a car nut, but I doubt he could have avoided it; he was brought home from the hospital in my E24 M6 and spent his toddler years cruising in either my Club Sport or the T-Bird Turbo Coupe(a manual, of course).  He always had a ball riding in my press loaners- especially the X5 4.6is, 645Ci, and Alpina B7. He even had the privilege of riding shotgun with Mike Valentine for 30 minutes at Mid Ohio- in Mike's GT3 RS 4.0. That said, he's not a Euro-snob, as he likes the Boss 302 as well as the C7 Corvette. I'm proud to say that he shares my ""No Boring Cars!"" philosophy."
1311,"In light of the recent scandal at VAG and their diesel ""special emission testing software"", seems like my words about a diesel scam were much more prophetic than even I imagined them myself.  I thought they were just playing games with the emission testing to make them look better, sort of like the EPA gas mileage tests are gamed by many manufacturers.  Now it looks like it was an actual scam."
1312,VW stock down 20% today.
1313,"20 percent may just be a start.  If European officials start digging and actually find something, who know how much that may cost them.  However, they are partly owned by one of their land (state) government, so they will find a ""workaoround""."
1314,I wonder what the regulations are in Europe and whether VAG and even others are also gaming the system?
1315,"The regulators in Europe are two-fold - European Commissions for Union-wide regulations and then the governments who adopt those regulations on their schedule, add something, sometimes negotiate removing or modifications.  Then local officials enforce those rules (diagnostic stations, etc.)."
1316,Time to buy some stock..
1317,I'd wait a bit longer.  EU officials are now allowing the EPA to investigate VW for doing the same in Europe.
1318,Was it time to buy Lumber Liquidators when 60 minutes broke out?   Not every drop is an automatic buy.  Sometimes stocks go down for a reason.  It's only a buy if you think the fines are going to be much less than that and no further news will come up.  I'd be very cautious with such optimism.
1319,Isn't this what the stock market is all about?
1320,"Well, yes and no."
1321,A host of another forum posted this link.  Good article.
1322,"So does this mean since my families new Golf Wagon TDI uses the ""blue"" fluid tank it isn't subject to this ""recall?"""
1323,"This may be the case.  I think VW is now in a ""hard stop"" mode.  They'll have to sort out which ones they need to recall."
1324,"How is it that with all of the supposed (by me) checks from governmental agencies on both sides of the Atlantic, that this went undetected?  Do the respective governments simply take the test data on face value?  No random or planned tests?  Company says car pollutes this much and it is not validated by any of the hands that the data goes through? Is like a deal where we trust and don't verify -- or essentially trust and allow the company to state its own claims ""as if""?"
1325,"Your car, apparently, also has a ""defeat device."" Even with the adblue, it looks like it pollutes much more than the law allows."
1326,"Just like with MPG, the EPA has companies ""self-certify."""
1327,"My put is that the car's computer can tell when it's being interrogated, at which time it switches various algorithms to generate the required results on the reader.  While the test is being performed, all is well, and when the test is finished, the ECO goes back to ""normal."""
1328,"This has already been discussed, in a different forum here at Edmunds.  The cheating algorithm (also known as a ""defeat"") looks for two things"
1329,"I think more blame should be placed on the test givers than the test takers.  If you design a test, you should do so in a way that makes it harder to ""cheat."""
1330,"Really?  In the case of auto companies self testing and reporting to the EPA requires a level of trust on both sides.  Perhaps I'm some sort of Polly Anna but IMHO, some level of honesty should be there."
1331,It seems strange to blame the EPA when VW itself has admitted it made a huge mistake?
1332,70% of autos sold in Europe are oil burners.  I would expect that 50% of these are the small block engines.  The small block engines are the ones claiming they need not be ad-blue to achieve improved emissions.
1333,"The engineers should have got word to the marketers, huh?"
1334,"The answer is YES.  18 billion is just a potential.  I expect that settle at 2-5 billion plus a few scapegoats of middle to high level.  The real one is if there is any issue with European market, half of their staff is going to prison.  BTW, 10-40 times would probably not pass 20 year standards, so the deceipt is beyond staggering.  This is not Hyundai adding couple of mpg, or Toyota overstating the engine power by 5 hp.  This is a systematic and brazen sabotage of the system."
1335,"Maybe, maybe not.  Keep in mind that the emissions requirements in Europe are not as strict as the CARB/EPA requirements so under the current tuning, the 2.0 may meet their standards.  My understanding is that a new emissions requirement just went into affect in Europe on 9/1 that brings diesel requirements much closer to the CARB levels.  It's possible that the VW won't pass this new standard."
1336,"What also bothers me here is that those VW's are small in numbers, but we all know how ""clean"" are trucks, buses and pickups.  VW cheating is a big deal on the priniple, but I would not go as far as calling them some kind of superpollutants.  They may be ecxeeding limits 40 times, but one can ask what kind of limits are on those stinky and noisy schoolbuses and semis, if their spewing big black clouds is within those limits."
1337,"Knowing how the financial institutions' thievery involving the financial crisis in 07/08 was addressed in the US (moderate fines at best, not even one exec imprisoned for the downfall of the entire economy), I suspect that the US government will slap their wrists and have a moderate punishment. Hopefully the EU regulators have a lot more teeth than the US does."
1338,"In case you missed it on the other thread, here's a 4-minute comic parody taken from a German film of ""Hitler Reacting to Dieselgate"". Audi is mentioned about 3 minutes in...."
1339,At least Canadian...
1340,"So we left Beaune Wed morning about 9am, destination, Charles de Gaulle (GDC) airport, most of BMW drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of CDG, but the day before I found a much  better flight out of London (Rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in London) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of London Heathrow, all flights were booked on Frequent Flyer Miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since I have elite status with AA, that is waved for me."
1341,Thanks FN....Great pics and a great travelogue.  What a great way to buy a car.
1342,"The new S4 has been announced and the details are impressive -- of course the question for the US market, as usual, are led by:  When will this (or some very similar version) be coming to our shores?  The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year.  Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3."
1343,flightnurse -
1344,"Mark we saw one RS3 in Europe it was a 3 door hatchback, just cursing on the highway with us slow pokes, Since the #40i has gained HP the S4 should too."
1345,"Ray, thanks.."
1346,Mark...don't know if you saw the details...
1347,"I heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option."
1348,Don't wait.  Order another one to your specs.  Trade in and get one of the last of the current generation while you can.  Reset the warranty clock & get one that hasn't been clobbered by a Lexus RX.
1349,Car manufactures will never make everybody happy. I would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the DSG in normal traffic Enthusiasts will always lose out.
1350,"First it was a Subaru not a lexus, second with the devalue of his S4 his trade in value is less. The accident I'm sure is on his car fax."
1351,"With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?"
1352,"I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4.  In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3.  To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such.  I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like.  People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense.  I don't mind feeling the shift under power."
1353,"Nope,"
1354,"As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good.  As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked.  Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding."
1355,"Congrats on joining the S4 owner ranks around here.  In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example)."
1356,"Here 'ya go, Gents....."
1357,Now that's funny.
1358,"If I recall correctly from the articles on the A4, that actually will come with the DSG as the sole transmission.  With the upgraded 2.0T and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment."
1359,breld:
1360,"Just did a bit more research - it appears that the DSG (7-speed) will be offered on the FWD models on the upcoming A4, with the AWD models continuing with the 8-speed.  That's according to a Consumer Reports article.  I can't say that I've driven a FWD A4 - for some reason you can't find them here in Colorado - but I have to imagine that DSG is a nice upgrade over the CVT."
1361,"Now,"
1362,Wow!  That is a nice wagon!  Love it.
1363,Nice write-up
1364,"I took a look, not a drive, a look, at the latest and greatest Mazda Miata which lists for a number beginning with a 2.  Not sure I'd want a two seater (then again, if the kid and 3 or 4 of his friends can't get in all at once, maybe that would be less, er, distracting).  But, the point is, this car seems to be ONE of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments I made above.  Also, there are a couple of VW's that seem to have some sizzle to them."
1365,"When my daughter was 17 and took over ""my"" Volvo (which was intended to be her car when we got it), she named it.  And first thing she did when we replaced it with the VW was think up a new name for it."
1366,"Mark, I'm 52,  I agree with you on the travels of Europe, and the secert if taking a train is to take an over night one.."
1367,"walking around Marseilles you see some interesting things, and cars, so enjoy today's photos.."
1368,FN...loving youre report and pics.
1369,"And that is why the French don't like Americans.  Most don't even bother to try to speak in French instead expecting everyone else to speak English.  Well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language.  Once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in English.  It's called courtesy.  How would you feel if a tourist came up to you in Cincinnati and started speaking in French without even an attempt to speak English?  I'm guessing the same as that waiter."
1370,"These sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places.  For example, in Belgium there are Flemish (Dutch) speekers and French Wallons.  Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials.  You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that.  It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French.  They do, but they want to be asked."
1371,Spoken like someone who knows what they do at Ft. Knox (besides store gold).  I've been involved with the engine since about '94.
1372,"I've never been to Europe, but my wife visited Italy about 3 yrs. ago.  Her interactions with the locals were very positive.  She'd love to go back.  As for the ""surly French"" - I've heard that same comment from many Americans of varied backgrounds who've visited France.  My opinion is if it wasn't for Americans like my late father who participated in D-Day they would be speaking German now.  And my late Aunt told that to a surly sales person she had an unpleasant interaction with in Paris.  God Bless America!!"
1373,"Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world.  Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals).  All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients).  Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him.  BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc.  You get the picture."
1374,"I don't mean to sound like an ""Ugly American"".  It's just that you hear so many comments from Americans of all stripes about rude and boorish behavior from the French.  Shame on any American who treats a French visitor rudely because they can't or won't speak English.  Also shame on any American visiting France who feels they are entitled to special treatment because of what happened during WW II.  I'm just asking for common courtesy."
1375,"Agreed.  There is no excuse for lack of courtesy, regardless if where you are.  Then working in a service industry, it should be you way of life."
1376,I agree 100%. I just can't stand the French attitude; in contrast I love the Italians and they seem to love us- and we DEFEATED them...
1377,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc.  I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University.  As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars.  I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives.  My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English."
1378,"France is the only country that acts like this, I speak Spanish, and I sign in American Sign Language, but sorry I don't speak french... If you don't like it, that is your issue not mine. So far the rudest drivers have been the french, if there is a cm of space they will take it, no signal they will just come over. Had a run in with a motorcyclist today, he wanted to cut in, front of me, and got all bent out of shape because I wouldn't back up to allow him to pass... He stood in front of our car and [non-permissible content removed] at us, that was until I got out of the car, he hoped back on his bike and took off, the karma of it was he rear ended a car about 5 cars in front of us, a55hole..."
1379,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars.  So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front..."
1380,"Excellent pictures and comments traveling Europe.  Some serious wheels at that wedding for sure (except the limo, of course!).  They really are getting good at bending metal at HyunKia!"
1381,"FN - Regarding your eqipment specifications: I see you went to all that trouble to arrange for ED, then got a strippie!"
1382,"Howdy group sorry about the silence, we are back in the states, so I can finish this photo log."
1383,"Actually, that's about the only way to get one without all the stuff that the dealers order theirs with and with the one or two options you care about, like color."
1384,It's a beautiful car but I predict that MB would sell 10's of them in North America.
1385,"The only way to tell really is to import it, but I think it would sell well."
1386,Wagony-wagons aren't such hot sellers anymore.
1387,"Well, not here, but many other places."
1388,"You haven't been to Europe, I would have to day, that 75% of all 3 series we saw was a Wagon,  We saw lot of A4 and A6 wagons, but yes here in the states we want SUV's... I'd take a wagon over a SUV any day."
1389,"So as I mentioned Beaune, France is in the heart of the Burgundy region of France. So the first day we just walked about Beaune, it's much bigger then what Rick and I assumed it was. Now, most towns in Europe are old, and Beaune is no different, we are talking settled right around 1440, so the charm of the city is the age, and how clean the city is. Besides being in the heart of the Burgundy region Beaune also is known for Hospices de Beaune which was founded in 1442, it's an amazing place, hospice holds a special place in my heart. So sit back and enjoy the photos of the city."
1390,"When we arrived in Beaune (Sat evening) at the resort we stayed at, Rick asked me, ""So, when we doing the winery tours?""... Ummm, Winery tours... I guess I forgot to book that..  You can't come to the heart of Burgundy country and not go on wine tours.. Now the walk of shame to the concierges as this is going to cost me.... Dearly...  Spoke to the concierges, told him what we were looking for, he nodded, and said he knew what to do... Oh lord, this will cost me..  Fast forward to Sunday morning, the same concierges informed us that he has us booked, cost 500 euro for the both of, and it's a PVT tour.. I knew it was going to cost me.."
1391,Second winery Chassagne-Montrachet
1392,You guys have more fun than I do on vacation.   Must be the $500 tours..
1393,"The bar has been set for trips and pics of vacations.  Who's next?  Not gonna be me, at least not this year."
1394,Maybe next year.. headed to Nicaragua in February.
1395,Couldn't the French claim that if it wasn't for them we'd still be speaking England's version of English?
1396,"I don't think people really know why they moved over into another land most of the time, maybe just out of habit."
1397,"So it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in Erbusco Italy, it's about 20 miles east of Bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins I have never meet before.. We are staying in a place called L'Alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking."
1398,Wow!
1399,Excellent photos.  I see your son's GT is one of the larger cars on your journey.
1400,FN....double WOW!!!!!!
1401,"Congrats, Nurse.  I have dark blue, too.  Mine is the older version (Deep Sea) rather than yours Imperial (I think), but they are quite similar."
1402,The Q50S is silver....looks clean for a very long time...can't see any dust!
1403,"Dino thanks, yes it's Imperial Blue, we both wanted Mediterranean blue but to get that color it would have been 4 week delay and $1930 bucks.. My 320 is Jet Black and know all about how dirty they get, but thanks for the warning.."
1404,Because they can . . .
1405,Entry level lux car sales for August:
1406,smaller entry-level sales:
1407,tight race for top 3 in luxury so far this year
1408,"It's all marketing and revenue maximization. Show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. BMW has been doing this for decades, Audi (at least in the US) not as long but they are getting there more and more."
1409,"Yes the Genesis was a trade in, BMW will allow us to keep it until re-delivery."
1410,"BMW has what they call Individual colors for both exterior and Interior leather colors, as well as Options, when you choose an Individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers."
1411,"So the trip from Slovenia to Erbusco Italy was a straight shot on the Autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern Italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. Once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights."
1412,"To live and work, Germany; to live and live and live, Italy."
1413,"Circle, the GT is my partners car, in the photo at The Welt, I'm the Younger one, (by 9 yrs)."
1414,"So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast.."
1415,Thank you Mark...
1416,"Some people will view your comment that people driving faster AND safer at the same time is blasphemy for the myth believers of ""speed kills."""
1417,"Curious FN since you had a picture at a tool booth. Is there some kind of transponder, or do you need change in the right currencies?  Or bills with these being a manned booth?"
1418,"We were at two ""rest stops"" and both were like that. Might have gotten them on a bad day. But so far the attitude of the French is, We've French we can do that, seems to apply."
1419,"Yes to all.  France has a transponder system call Liber-T that works like EZ Pass.  The toll booths take cash in multiple currencies including Euros, US Dollars, Swiss Francs, UK Pounds, et al as well as credit cards."
1420,"You commented about German, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about French personalities.  Granted, my European travels have been entirely recreational, but I would say that only in 2 countries have I ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious.  France (several times) and Switzerland once in Lucerne (come to think of it the person in Lucerne had a heavy French accent.)"
1421,I would only return to France if we were at war with that country- and I had an M1A2 with at least 500 rounds of M830A1 ammunition.
1422,"You can buy a ""pass"" ahead of time, but since the machine was in french I didn't know how to use, so at each toll booth, I'd pay with cash, now the most expensive toll was in Italy, 32 Euro"
1423,"Agreed!  The car looks great, and the experience seems awesome!"
1424,"More photo's are to come and it's been stated it's the Europe only Active Tourer, which was to come to the US but BMWNA said no. VERY Roomy !!!  Lots of cool cars over here, one thing I noticed is, MB, BMW and Audi's are de-badged of the model, most if not all of the Euro ED cars had no car identifier on the rear, it's on option for them, but BMWNA does not allow US customers to do that..."
1425,"US MSRP for the car was 53K  sale price was 47K  We flew into Frankfurt, then onto Munich the flight to Munich was a trip.. I'll post a lot more about this whole adventure."
1426,"Excellent choice, FN.  I wish your son the best of luck with his exceptional choice!"
1427,"Actually, the new BMW X1 is supposed to be largely based on the Active Tourer FWD platform."
1428,Which shares a lot of DNA with the new MINIs.
1429,"Back in the '90s a CCA member I know used ED to get an E34 535i; while in Germany he took it to AC Schnitzer and had the engine's power bumped up considerably. He instructed ACS NOT to add a custom valve cover or any badges, etc. that would give the game away. When the car made it to his dealer the engine had a noticeable lope. The salesman offered to let the Service Department check out the ""misfire,"" but the new owner declined and happily drove away..."
1430,"In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car.  Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this."
1431,"So just to chime on what is is saying about mobile phones, when I first got my job with Sony, I bought a Panasonic ""trans mobile"" phone. It was the size of text book, you could either mount it in the car or take it with you. OF course I thought I was cool at the time, that was until I got my first bill... After that I used it strictly for work. Mobile phones where just starting to make their way into cars, this was 1987."
1432,"So more adventure with FN, Fussen to Salzburg."
1433,"Regarding drivers who don't use hands free technology in their luxury or near luxury cars (or any car where that technology is available): IMO most of those folks are either too stupid or too lazy to use it.  It's the American way to use the quickest, simplest route.  I guess there is the arrogance factor to also consider.  Some drivers feel that they can drive safely with the phone in one hand, one eye on the phone and the other on the road."
1434,"It's a wonderful part of the world -- enjoy.  Five of the seven times I've visited Switzerland and/or Austria, the weather was rainy, snowy or otherwise inclement.  Be thankful for the wonderful weather you appear to be ejoying, and thanks for the updates."
1435,"I've never had the pleasure of traveling to Europe, so the stories and pictures FN is posting are really welcome."
1436,"FN -- I don't know how everyone else feels, but I want you to know you cannot post too many pictures as far as I'm concerned."
1437,???
1438,"If I'm not mistaken, here in Colorado, you can get ticketed for driving in the left lane on the highway if you're not passing.  I'm not so sure how much it is enforced, but I do like that the law is at least there."
1439,"It happens everywhere.  I see people all the time getting over to the left hand lane although their current lane doesn't have any traffic in it.  If they move to the left and are impeding traffic due to their concentration being on their cell phone, I will slowly pass on the right, beep my horn and give the international ""hang up the phone"" sign so they get they are moving too slowly."
1440,"Well, that's one.  I guess I'm talking about a ""national and cultural"" mindset that almost literally develops hives or some other nasty rash when contemplating the notion of passing on the right and ignoring a polite three wink left turn-signal."
1441,"we have the stay right, pass left law here in NJ. It is rarely obeyed and almost never enforced. The Pennsylvanians on our roads are almost guaranteed to ignore it, from my experience."
1442,"A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding.  Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced."
1443,"I was blessed to be able to spend five weeks in Europe in the summer of 1981; just knocking around with a friend who taught at a French-English school in Deauville. She and I toured Austria, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Eight years later a friend of mine and I wrangled some press passes for the Frankfurt Auto Show; we brought our wives with us and spent two ""Press Only"" days in Frankfurt and then rode around Germany for a couple of days. We hope to go back sometime sooner than later. My mom's side of the family came from Diersburg. I'm one of the few people who had relatives who flew in the Luftwaffe as well as the AAC..."
1444,"I'll give them a chance to move over..  but, I'm not sitting in the fast lane for 5 miles behind someone doing 10 MPH under the traffic flow.   At some point, you have to go around.    What if they were doing 30 mph?"
1445,"yeah, I don't get the idea of making it illegal to pass on the right. I would hope, however, if a state has both no pass on right AND stay right pass left laws, a cop is going to pull the left-lane camper over instead of the right-lane passer."
1446,"Traffic flow = the ""Natural Speed Limit.""  Several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even.  The flow of traffic like the ebb and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own.  Efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do."
1447,"Mark our car is a US spec car, the nav is in English, but we have it set for Kilometers to work with the signs.. Everything is in English except for distance. I'm getting to know how far a meter is..."
1448,"I actually found the previous generation A3 and GTI to differ greatly.  However, with the GTI continually making many improvements, I find the 2015 GTI to finally be up to snuff.  Of course, since they've caught up at VW with the GTI to the A3, they no longer offer a 5-door A3 (although I think that's changing with the A3 E-Tron's)."
1449,"The fact traffic enforcement concentrates on speeding tickets (which lead to virtually no danger or accidents), and routinely completely ignores left lane passing laws is one of the biggest crimes of the past century.  Police should absolutely ticket the driver causing the problem (the left lane impeder) rather than the symptoms (people passing on the right)."
1450,Don't let science get in the way of good politics and government funding...
1451,"I maintain it all starts at the network size - too big to control and maintain consistency, especially for premium brand.  It simply doesn't fit their current volumes, looks like by favtor of three.  Also, it seems it's not just those bad dealers, it's GM's relationship with them that appears to be dowright toxic."
1452,"I do think in the past, that there was a loyalty to a brand or car company that isn't as strong today.  I know my dad was more of a GM man than Ford man and he had a disdain for Chrysler yet his first car was a Plymouth and he told me it served him well.  Dad wasn't that keen on Chevys, but he was ok with Pontiac, Olds, or Cadillac.  For some reason Buick didn't have any appeal to him.  Though there has been  the odd Toyota, Datsun, Subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my sisters to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 Aurora, have stayed the course with GM products.  They currently have a CR-V."
1453,"I think its simply a matter of age. You gotta reach far back to find most of the Cadillac fans, like my dad and father-in-law, and they aren't buying cars in that pricerange in their golden years. Those same people would NEVER consider a BMW. The BMW faithful, on the other hand, largely have a car history that dates back to the E30-E36 era, and those cars cemented their fandom. Cadillac is now chasing a younger crowd who never previously gave them a 2nd look, while BMW is slowly alienating its fans with softer cars. How will that all pan out? We'll see."
1454,"effectively BMW is aging with their fanbase. Caddy had a head start, and once they ""age out"" you are kind of stuck.  At least BMW is still bringing in younger buyers at the bottom end, even if they are a different type than they used to have!"
1455,"Apparently they are not interested in ""driving dynamics"" as much as they used to be -- on the  other hand, we'd be hard pressed these days to find virtually any up and coming ""customer"" to even consider a manual transmission; sport suspensions, too, seem to be largely in the rearview mirror -- I remember when MOST of the cars in stock had sport suspensions, sport seats and at the same time a good many of the cars in stock were manual shift models, replete with Premium pack, power assists, and other options of the day."
1456,"With newer magnetic ride control suspension systems, it seems logical that the ""sport"" suspension will be more ""automatic"" along with the softer settings when you want the smoother ride.  Just like what happened in the transmission arena."
1457,"Mark's comment about GM's quality going to hell in the 70's and 80's and   paying a price for that is well taken.  During that time I was starting a career and family and money was tight.  All I could afford was Chevys and I was satisfied, until my '79 Chevette.  It broke down 12 miles from the dealer's showroom the day I picked it up and had to be towed back.  That was just the beginning of the problems.  I traded it for a Mazda GLC several months later and have owned nothing but Japanese cars since, with 2 reliable Fords in the mix.  I now have a Volvo S60, as I mentioned in a prior post and an Outback, my 3rd Subaru."
1458,"So, we arrived in Munich today, was picked up at the Airport in a BMW 750Ld, nice car, great engine, Tri Turbo inline 6 diesel. it makes something like 450lbs of torque. was interesting to watch the drive navigate the highway. We topped 150mph, I've read about about this car, was great to be driven in it. Friday we take delivery of Ricks BMW."
1459,"This morning a friend called and asked me to take his latest toy for a drive; said toy is a 2007 Mercedes-AMG E63 fitted with the Weistec M156 Power Package 1, meaning it makes 441 hp and 394lb-ft of torque measured at the wheels. He's a bit intimidated by the car and wanted me to wring it out. Now THIS is a car I can truly call fast with a straight face. Stock it would do 0-60 in 4.2 seconds and run the quarter in 12.6 seconds"
1460,"$86k? Eh, I'd be looking at a Panamera or Tesla, methinks"
1461,"I did look at a Panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the A8, the price would shoot over $100K."
1462,Tesla for me.
1463,When are you making the move?  I've never had the guts to take a test drive since they seem [still] out of reach.
1464,No range anxiety for me.
1465,"I just got into the Q50 so the Tesla will be a few years off.  I think I will take you up on a test drive soon, however.  I always wanted to experience the car since it became available. I'll let you know if/when I do."
1466,"We took my buddy's Mercedes-AMG E63 to the 1/8 mile strip tonight. My best run was 8.12 seconds- which is the fastest the car has gone. Beat a 1970 Buick GS Stage I with a built 455 running slicks and also dispatched a modified Lexus IS F. It was my first visit to the strip since 1976 and I had a ball. The spectators' initial reaction, ""What's a Mercedes doing at a drag strip?"" changed to ""What kind of motor does he have in that thing?"""
1467,"So we picked up Ricks BMW at the Welt, much different experience then when I got my 2005 330 back in 2005. They really treat you like a VIP. We are in southern Germany in a Town called Fussen.  We are off to Salzburg for a couple of days. The car looks much better in person then we had thought it would, the Rim's are different then what BMW had showed up, we like these better."
1468,"Having two ""real muscle cars"" from the 60's and 70's, I can say they are fast, but not as fast as cars today... No surprise that the MB was quicker."
1469,"My late Father would not have considered any thing from Europe, Japan....anywhere other than U.S. based brands."
1470,"someday, maybe I will be able to do that.  another couple of years until college bills are finished. Maybe that will be the treat for us!"
1471,"FN, living vicarously with you guys and your European delivery.  Car and scenery are beautiful.  Keep us up on things and enjoy."
1472,"Oh, I totally agree on the price argument. I would find it very difficult to spend 6 figures on a car unless I had ridiculous money to blow. But, even then, when I think about a lottery-winning wishlist in a 20-car garage, it just makes far more sense to me that I would have 2 or 3 nice classics or retrorods rather than a $100k new car."
1473,Ditto!
1474,It is a
1475,"My wife and I have been to Europe/Germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include Germany, that is) -- we always fly into Munich, even if our destination is Venice or Zurich or even Vienna.  Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work.  Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work.  The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like."""
1476,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP.  It  makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller.  So for  example 50k base plus 5k options  plus 900 destination it is  52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings.  However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED).  You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it.  Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times.  I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car.  Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal."
1477,"They probably should change the name, too.  While there is some brand equity left for older folks, I suspect people under 40 could not care less.  They need to rebuild, but their problem they don't seem to get it."
1478,"I thought the same thing---Cadillac should have had a new name 10 years ago, e.g. Toyota/Lexus. The Lexus name became gold-plated in about ten years time."
1479,"Ah, the UAW.  Now I understand.  I spent several years researching the history of the U.S. steel industry over the decades after 1970.  Interesting stuff."
1480,"I don't have a problem with the caddy keeping its name - problem is they kept its ways . No way an ATS and cts should be priced anywhere near its German comp ( not now). When people talk about what kind of deal they got on said caddy - nice job but car should be lower just given track record and current sales trends, given the time of year you can get 10% off a 3 series. Lexus did it right- time to start over again caddy. Would also add to the union stuff above - cannot believe the leader ship will let a potential collapse happen again in less then 10 years. Let's hope they are amarter."
1481,I have to admit that I probably would never have even looked at the Caddy had it not been for the DEEP discounts they were offering at the time. So y'all are probably right that they should cut their prices to re-establish themselves. I just worry that they would take that as a reason to skimp on the car. This is a seriously nice piece of machinery with an impressive interior. It needs to remain that way.
1482,"Exactly.  Now that they are serious, they need to come in under the competition from the start. When I walk up to a window sicker today, I walk away shaking my head. I don't want an anchor price that is in BMW/Merecdes range staring me out from the window of a Caddy.  Not gonna happen!"
1483,"But then there is their cost structure.  How low is low and can GM make money?  I would bet Toyota didn't make much, if anything in first ten years of Lexus. That's why I'm not not optimistic about them, at all."
1484,"Q...your car is indeed quite nice, regardless of the parameter you're using as a measuring stick....performance, materials, etc."
1485,"Jeez, I've wanted a Caddy since I was 16.  I got my Medicare card this year, so I doubt it's going to happen.  I almost bought a CTS way back in 2005 when they were offering employee discount prices.  But the CTS was RWD only back in those days and we live in the snow belt.  I looked at an ATS in 2013, but priced with the options I wanted it was out of reach.  I ""settled"" on a Volvo S60.  Great car and very good dealer experience."
1486,"That's essentially a full overhaul.  Add a name change for a good measure.  I truly believe they should try do ""a Lexus"", but I doubt they will."
1487,"Think about that for a second, though ... there is a reason why Acura/Volvo is cheaper than Benz/BMW [and I'll add Lexus], and its not just because they choose to be. I'll give you a hint: it is also why the Lexus ES V6 is cheaper than the IS V6."
1488,"How about NOT lowering the actual sticker price but figuring out a way to get a bunch of the cars out there via the traditional sub-venting of leases.  I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there)."
1489,they already include maintenance.
1490,You're looking at the content.  I'm looking at the brand equity.   Cadillac simply doesn't have it.  There are only two ways to build it:
1491,"""good lease deals is certainly a good idea."""
1492,"Probably the reason GM started offshore production in the first place.  As soon as I hear ""union negotiations"", I think of the broken model that they had a chance to fix at bankruptcy but failed and claimed such a success....just kicking the can down the road."
1493,"I've thought about this a lot.  Not necessarily the union aspect, as they're a shell of their former self, and wield a lot less power."
1494,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics.  Law blatantly disregarded  - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes).  This basically taught them wrong lesson."
1495,The only decision I can make is with my wallet and my vote.  My wallet will not vote for GM or a separated Cadillac.
1496,dino001:
1497,"Agreed.  Outside of Escalade, Cadillac is in a bind very hard to solve."
1498,Spot on.
1499,Popularity of the escalade has always been a mystery to me.
1500,No more Hummer!  A certain clientele need BIG.
1501,"We'll always have pimps, hip-hop artists, and Major League athletes..."
1502,Pimpin' ain't easy.
1503,My put is that any car made by any manufacturer these days that survives infant mortality (doesn't need the dealer to mess with it inside of the first year or 10K miles) will run well and true for 100K miles or much more.
1504,"Maybe Gm needs to only sell GM branded cars- Gm corvette, Gm escallade ..etc. get rid of the massive dealership network and duplicate cars like Chevy small suv and Buick small SUVs. If they need to keep caddy / Buick name call the cars Gm Chevy impala or something. Massive overhead continues to kill companies. Now I understand and have read in the news that major companies ""reorganize"" at certain times like today's"
1505,"Having only one well selling model makes Cadillac very vulnerable.  Think Acura - without MDX it's basically non-factor.  The cars may be good quality and even better value, but nobody cares.  RDX had a jolt recently, but I can't tell if it's sustained.   TLX, CLX and especially RLX are not selling, the last one will be a rare classic in ten years"
1506,Whatever Happened to . . . .
1507,"Mark, if anything, the link proves that Subaru could be argued as a winner.  It holds its own against motor with extra  65 hp and two cylinders.  It cost 20 grand  less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category).  Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority.  And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so.  Extra stuff, better AWD.  I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better.  Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value.  Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0,  see who wins.  And  WRX still costs less.  Even STI may cost less than A4/A5."
1508,"Will the NSX, Acura's upcoming $150,000 halo car, help spur sales of more entry-level vehicles? That's the plan. Difficult to say if it'll pan out, but I think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for Acura dealers. Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:"
1509,"Well, both the Subarus and the NSX are not in this discussion topic. Subarus are far from luxury class and  a $150k two door coupe is hardly an entry level sedan."
1510,"Looked at the CPO 2013 335is today; still not all that enthused. I hate the 19"" wheels- more suceptable to damge, degraded ride comfort, and no performance advantage- so figure around $2500 for a decent set of 18"" tires and wheels from Tire Rack. The STI or Mustang GT PP looks better all the time."
1511,"NSX has been a long time  coming. And, just like SH AWD tech, whatever is introduced in the flagship NSX will eventually make it to the lower level cars (like the Perf/Lux TLX)."
1512,"Nobody says it's ELLPS (it's not), only that its AWD system in sport models (WRX, STI) is at least in par with Audi's."
1513,"So any cheap car with a big engine fits this category?  I thought luxury brands were pretty well  defined and Ford, Subaru, etc are not.  But I guess by some strange logic a Mustang is both a luxury car and a sedan."
1514,I'd like to congratulate
1515,"At this point, as I said, most of us are unable to notice the subtleties between most AWD systems, regardless of MSRP.  I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit)."
1516,"Checked out a new CTS 4cylt T Performance = $58,000 sticker. 272hp/295lb.-ft."
1517,"Own one.  The purchase price came in well below the MSRP you saw (at the time, in the neighborhood of low $40s).  Personally, I think it's one of the best looking cars in the segment.  And, that little turbo motor is a gem....comparable to the one in the BMW 528i or Audi A6 2.0 (actually, feels better than both)."
1518,"that'd be me, and at just a couple grand more MSRP than the $58k 2.0T Performance you mention, circleW, the V sport makes infinitely more sense to me."
1519,I thought your disaster CTS was the old model.
1520,"The ""V"" would be more in line with that price range, for sure...not an under 300 HP motor.  The one I saw was the Performance, loaded, but I'd bet you could not get that particular car for the low $40K range.. low $50's, ok."
1521,"Saw some blurbs on the CTS-V.  C&D was gushing all over it, stating BMW M5 has been knocked off its perch.....stating..."
1522,As an s4 owner I would like to chime in with the subi comments. iMO For the money not a better awd system to buy is a subi with the boxer engine. Someone mentioned cost to own made a valid point the cars are in high demand on the used car market and some used car dealers are having issues getting cars from auctions because even high mileage leased cars are going back on manufactures lots because resale is so strong and they are not producing new ones fast enuf - don't believe me??
1523,"2014 ATS V6 Premiums grab around $32k at auction. So figure somewhere in the mid $36k range retail. The 4-cyl Luxury models, however, are in the mid 20s, so high 20s is possible if you don't want a ""jacked out"" version and can deal with the base non-turbo engine."
1524,Msrp for new v sport prem is 70k starting price -mid  high 40's for a 1.5 yr old - wow. . I just checked the website and could not believe they can hope to charge that much for new one. Dooh!
1525,A BMW 550i with roughly the equipment in a vsport premium is about $75k and trading for $51k at the auction. So it is pretty much on par for the midsize luxo market.
1526,"Agree completely.  It is too soon to charge that much. And, seems to me there are just too many stories like the following:"
1527,"Could it be that the 550 has had major engine trouble with a fix costing close to 15K, lucky BMW is picking up the tab this... I thought about a 550, but once I read the problems and issues I wont be buying one."
1528,M5 compares to CTS-V
1529,"Well, GM is considering importing Buicks from China but for 2 models.  Really, Buick is dead being mfg in the USA."
1530,"ATS was supposed to overwhelm the 3 series. Not for the performance, but the price killed Caddy."
1531,It's posturing for the upcoming negotiations with the UAW.
1532,My son's 2004 X3 2.5i was purchased in December 2005 and paid off in January 2007. I wish I had been leasing a car since then- think of all the money I would have saved.
1533,"But for some people, a used BMW with high miles might fit with its nick-name: Break My Wallet."
1534,"Well, like I said, if you don't do your homework(like the nitwit you mentioned with the 335i- or the wearers who pay $7k for a Beemer[sic] from a BHPH lot) ) with respect to a PPI, finding a good shop, and selecting a car with a good long term prognosis, of course you can get hosed."
1535,Totally agree
1536,"So, whether it's sooner (this year) or later (next year), I'm seriously thinking of pulling the trigger on an S4.  The only other car I'm seriously considering is the 4 series GC."
1537,"Young people just express this differently. Many find ""utility"" far more attractive than ""performance"". Perhaps that's what you're noticing."
1538,"mark - I have to agree.  I would have to say that most under 30 have no interest in automobiles.  As hard as I tried, my 18 YO could care less about cars."
1539,"My son is taking his driver's test tomorrow morning.  He is maniacal about cell phones and gaming consoles.  Only a passing interest in cars.  But, to give him props, he much prefers my XF to Mom's 535xi (and expects me to give him the XF immediately upon licensure!).  His car interest usually starts in the 7 figure range, he seems to admire the Bugatti Veyron.  My guess, he'll have one before me..."
1540,"Don't forget, some new players on the field coming up to bat.  If you wait, you can try the Jag XE and Alfa Giulia and post reviews here!"
1541,"My son is almost 21 and has a fairly strong interest in cars. He prefers performance cars but is patient and waiting until he is out on his own to get one. Currently he likes the M3/4, Cayman S, GT350, STI, and the Hellcat Challenger- as well as some true exotics. He has had a lot of exposure to the performance side, hanging out at O'fest with me and shagging rides in fairly quick cars such as a B7 press loaner and a GT2 RS."
1542,We can build him a Hellcat beater for less $$$. Check out this month's issue of Hotrod magazine.
1543,"I do want to make it clear: I wouldn't throw a BMW 335i out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd probably be willing to BRING the crackers.  Translation:  If I couldn't have an Audi, I'd have a BMW without any hesitation.  For some reason, I don't have the same feeling about the Mercedes models that are often compared to the Audi A4 and A6 lineup (or the BMW 3 and 5 series lineup.)"
1544,Subaru
1545,"The current 335i/435i does nothing for me; perhaps the 340i/440i will reignite my enthusiasm for the marque, but I wouldn't hold my breath. As for AWD, I like Audis OK, but I prefer the more aggressive character of the STI."
1546,Subaru
1547,The badge on the back of our 2015 Outback says symmetrical.
1548,"One person's ""long haul"" is another's break-in period.  This'll be interesting to watch."
1549,"What he said with exception of CVT and old 4AT Subarus used 90/10 split, 5AT six cylinder engines had 45/55 split, I think.  Don't know today.  Manual Subies had 50/50 with STI extra feature of driver-controlled bias adjustment, I think it was +/- 20.  Audi's setup was also dictated by engine position - transverse had Haldex AWD, longitudinal had Torsen, as a rule of thumb."
1550,"I'd agree on the more car for the money, at least for now.  A 428xi GC equipped as I'd like it (and comparable in features to the S4) is about the same money as the S4."
1551,"I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen.  As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex.  Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms."
1552,"not all kids.  My son (24) likes cars, and has gotten deep into the German kool aid pitcher.  he is really antsy to get through his Jetta lease, and move up to an Audi (A3 or S3)."
1553,"I would agree, but Subaru was only mentioned because somebody wrote something like ""nobody does awd better than audi."""

1555,"OK, how 'bout this: ""Audi certainly has its fans and foes, but those in both camps agree, if you're looking for an AWD premium luxury performance sedan, the short list has Audi atop it!"""
1556,"if you don't have the right tires, even with 8-wheel drive you aren't going anywhere."
1557,Cool.  I agree that platform sharing isn't badge engineering.
1558,"There is still some ""badge engineering"" in other manufacturers, including VAG.  In Europe, they have Skoda, Seat, VW models differing mostly by some styling and interior, but essentially identical otherwise (with ""special model"" exceptions).  Not as visible here, as VW to Audi separation is much more pronounced, especially within current US market offerings.  Other do much worse job of separating models, especially in lower end of the premium brands, where majority of their entry level models are barely changed in comparison to their close common relatives.  Lincoln MKZ/Ford Fusion, Acura CLX/Honda Civic come in mind, especially their lower level trims.   Even previous generation Audi A3/VW Golf GTI were not as far apart, as they should be."
1559,"I've driven a number of rental Skodas in Europe, and they are very worthy vehicles.  Of course, they'll never be offered over here."
1560,"I was in the Prague airport several years ago and there was a Skoda on display -- did a double take, it was a Passat without any of the VW logos, etc.  Now, the car was roped off, so I really couldn't peek inside to see if the interior was also a Passat, but, whatever differences there were, were minor."
1561,"Ah, yes - the corporate parts bin. Why design and manufacture a unique part?"
1562,"Wow.  982 dealers selling fewer units than 282 dealers.  I thought Cadillac will have to cut its network in half, but it seems it will have to leave a quarter, maybe a third.  This is basically impossible.  Just imagine legal battles, payoffs, etc."
1563,You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance.
1564,"No. Credit check can't be pulled from your DL number. They want to make sure you have a valid DL, first of all, before letting you drive their car on their insurance. They also want ID in case you run off with their car. Seems pretty reasonable."
1565,"The premium car dealerships (we've visited) rarely ask for documentation prior to a test drive -- I dunno, maybe they size up the customer based on the car they drive in. Also, arriving as a couple probably doesn't hurt either."

1584,Yep.  I'll say that all of those things (expendables) should be pretty obvious in their lack of replacement/repair with a relatively quick test drive and a quick look under the chasis and under the hood.

1589,"I must be in the minority.  If the model recommends premium, I put premium in my loaners.  I want the loaner buyer to buy a car cared for like it was my personal car."
1590,I do to.  But the people who are paying $299 a month with $2999 down plus tax don't put PUG.
1591,I think we are a bit special breed here.  More typical are those mentioned by NYC.
1592,I must be odd.  I have not had a loaner in at least 10 years.
1593,"Wow - I can arrange for a loaner at all three dealers I frequent for service - Hyundai, Subaru or MINI."
1594,"Seems like those guys at Cadillac are even more removed from reality than we all thought.  Their sales are crashing, in segments that should bring growth,  they don't want to put incentives out, they raise prices, yet they want to sell 500,000 units by 2020.  They do say of a small SUV plans.  Hopefully more than just a rebadged Chevy."
1595,I think GM is starting to fall back into their old ways. Rebadged Equinox coming as a Buick; rebadged Encore is now the Chevy Trax.
1596,"well, the Acura dealer does offer them.  But in 3 years, I have never been in for anything that wasn't covered under the express service, so I never had to stay more than an hour, so no point in leaving.  Hyundai, well, that had 1 oil change, so I just waited."
1597,Aw c'mon now.  These are more than badge jobs.  They are shared platforms with little shared outside of that.  Should we chastise VW for sharing an 8  year old platform between the current A4 and the new Porsche Macan?
1598,I suppose not.
1599,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today.  It's about making cars different enough.  There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other.  A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC.  An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron."
1600,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive.  Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices.  Or did the competition creep their prices upward?"
1601,"Where is Sony now?  Sony started higher because they used to have a product that was at least arguably better and most innovative.  Later on they stopped innovating, diluted the brand.  Sony is a shadow of its old self.  To wish Cadillac to go Sony way is to basically wish it to die slow and painful death."
1602,"Cadillac seems to be revising their pricing structure for 2016, so I think they're getting the message that they have to set a price about $10K below MB and Lexus."
1603,Can you elaborate?  Are they lowering prices by large increments?  This would certainly be interesting news.
1604,"Granted, I have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like cars, but the CTS starts at $5k less than the 5-series. The 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, OK, not so great there. But then you are back to a $5k delta with the V sport vs 550i. The CTS already starts nearly $9k less than its E-class counterparts."
1605,"Those all are too small differentials.  They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady.  At least for now.  The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep.  The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big.  There is a history showing such big moves never work.  You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years.  Lexus knew it and where are they now.  Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models.  They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
1606,"Back in January, Cadillac cut the MSRP on the CTS anywhere from $1-3,000."
1607,"Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab."
1608,"Lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. If Hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work.  Selling 70K limousine next to 15K econobox is actually a very difficult proposition.  However, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience.  The latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle."
1609,"As someone who worked at Sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when I left in 97, every segment Sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, Thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, Sony wouldn't give up on the DAT player for Car Audio or BETA video recorder, two complete failures. Then Sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in Mexico, other brands were getting better and Sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed Sony in sales. If it wasn't for the PlayStation, I really think Sony would be a completely different company then it is today."
1610,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5.  The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan.  Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan."
1611,Bradd - the MLB platform is used as the basis for:
1612,"I'll be a dissenting voice here and say I like the styling of the new C-class.  I think it offers a different, elegant alternative to the comparable BMW and Audi.  I do agree it looks a bit too much like the CLA, but not sure that's a bad thing."
1613,I sat in a new style C (used). Looked nice to me. Really liked the interior.
1614,"Having met you, is that a ""figurative"" fit or a ""literal"" fit?"
1615,"So I guess the star on the hood overcomes anything.  Essentially nobody else can get away with that, not even BMW - their version of 328/335 with the plastic seat covers usually become lot queens, at least here (can't speak of 320, as those are obviously different kind of buyers, they may go for it much more often)."
1616,Sometimes I just cringe when someone calls me sir -- I think it heralds the beginning of the end.

1621,"And in return, Infiniti gets to use the MFA platform from the A/CLA/GLA to underpin the Q30/QX30."
1622,Here is hoping it turns out to be a 340!!
1623,"Well in some ways, if it is a 340xi with the equipment we ordered we got one hell of a deal, and I can see  how fast we can sell it and make a nice profit."
1624,"Well, the dealer has lowered the online price by $2,500- but it's still about $4,000 too high. And I'm still not sure that it will keep me entertained for the long haul..."
1625,"Well, figuratively, though I haven't spent much time in one, so could be literal too."
1626,"I find that fewer and fewer things entertain me at all, let alone for the long haul."

1628,"Looking over recent posts it is obvious that Mr. Lutz,  however valid his qualifications, did hit on something important.  As long as people are going to rule out (or seek out) cars based on design and styling car makers would do well to hire the best designers they can."
1629,Well Lincoln has brought their age down from 65 in 2012 so things are moving in a positive manner.
1630,Well that's good but keep in mind that age 61 is still an *average*.
1631,"MB always seems to have a decent amount of trunk money available.  Dealers purchase ""lot queens"" for their service department, punch them as ""sold,"" pocket the incentive money, use the cars for service loaners for 5K to 10K miles, & then sell them 6 months down the road for a good price compared to brand new at a nice, tidy profit.  My only issue with buying an ex-service loaner German car is the fact that you know the majority of people put RUG (87) in the car before they returned it even though it requires PUG (91+)."
1632,Well the average age of a Bugatti buyer is 60.  Does that mean that only old codgers buy them?
1633,"Since the computer adjusts for the octane, it really shouldn't be an issue."
1634,You have data to prove this?
1635,"Anecdotal experience.. from all of the luxury buyers that ask, ""Do I have to run Premium in my XYZ luxury car?"", would lead me to believe that's true.."
1636,"No, I don't have any actual proof, but I just know how people are."
1637,"I'd concur that there is a very good chance for it.  Similar with rental cars - I recently got a PUG Mazda MX-5.  After I refueled it with PUG (it was a long mileage rental), the car got much more lively.  I'm pretty sure it was full of RUG."
1638,"Only knowing the mean does not provide enough information to declare that ""about half"" of the buyers are old codgers. To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often.  The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish."
1639,"I always put premium gas in the ""free-loaners"" the dealer provides; my wife does too.  It never even occurred to me that putting anything less in the tank was an option."
1640,Perhaps he's not as bright as you are giving him credit?
1641,"I can't really say. I know in politics one can go far without high intelligence, but you must have a superior kind of rat-like cunning to survive. So maybe that's it."
1642,"Wow, I wonder why he gets his own column (as in don't they know?) and why he seems to be quoted so often. I had really almost no idea of who he was/is, but his style is somewhat Donald Trump-like."
1643,"He says really good things and really dumb things. He's a hip-shooter, so it's bound to come out badly now and then. Probably his worst gaffe was to challenge Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson on climate change on national TV. His argument was that climate change was a complete hoax and isn't happening at all because he owns a house in the Florida Keys and it's not underwater."
1644,He should have been more clever when at GM.
1645,"Personally, I like Bob Lutz.  His Book...CAR GUYS VS BEAN COUNTERS is probably one of the top 10 business books I've ever read.  Lessons there for other companies outside the auto industry.  I tend to read his columns and listen to his interviews."
1646,Another story on Cadillac:
1647,"He makes sense, but only if they close more than half of the dealers and limit the production.  They'll run him from town first.  Too many vested interest.  No chance. This is a ten year program with constituance having patience for a couple of quarters."
1648,"For the most part, the typical Cadillac dealer is simply not prepared to sell cars to customers that still have all their own teeth..."
1649,"It's not about the age, it's about customer experience philosophy.  My feels is Cadillac's dealers are mentally closer to Toyota's, Vokswagen's than to Lexus's, or Audi's.   Part of that is the past, part is the financial structure and the way they are are compensated by the parent company."
1650,"GC, Lutz was also Rogers Smiths Yes man, and we all know what Roger Smith did GM..."
1651,"Cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace."
1652,The automakers would much rather have you buy a new car for tens of thousands rather than plug and play a few modules and keep your current vehicle for a few more years.
1653,"The biggest issue I see is production cycle and spare parts.  While it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive.  Moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, I think it is ten or so.  Increase number of variations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately."
1654,"Overall I'm not a huge fan of the current body style C-Class.  The baby S Class styling is too much.  I don't like the current S class styling either.  However, I've always got my eye open.  On my way to the beach this afternoon I saw a gorgeous black/black C300 4Matic Sport sedan.  It had the lip spoiler on the back, the sporty looking 5 spoke wheels, the led lighting package.  Very sharp looking.  So I just built one online.  Given that I'm a man of adding few options these days, I just opted for what I thought I needed to make the C300 my own.  $47K & change sticker price.  I'm sure the 241 horsepower turbo 4 would be plenty motivation for my purposes, given the fact that my daily driver pumps out a whopping 175 horsepower."
1655,What options did you do?
1656,"MB Tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't.  A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida.  Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz.  I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400.  No, thank you.  Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one)."
1657,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class.  Pretty impressive, IMHO.  Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch.  I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather.  Some say you can't tell the difference.  I certainly can, and it's not even close.  That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality."
1658,I'm too am not a big fan of the S Class shrinky dink styling.
1659,"I also don't like the looks of the new C class. I've actually thought about getting  a couple year old C-class at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new."
1660,"I agree.. the previous one was striking...     It's like they tried to make this one look like the CLA, and it worked... it's not a good look."
1661,"I think you're right.  Perhaps something changed, or I checked something too much.  It is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328.  BMW has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be.  I remember being absolutely shocked first time I optioned one to a comparable equipment with my E91 wagon.  It was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing.  Admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous.  So I may stand corrected on this.  It is annoying though, when local Benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is MB Tex on C-class (also GLA, CLA).  Even E-class comes with MB Tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which I find absolutely ridiculous.  It apparently works.  I wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care."
1662,"I read once that BMW's styling is based on 3-series and it is ""blow-up"" to their bigger models, including X-series (except of course their smallest models), whereas MB is shrink-down from the S-class.  Apparently, the former works better, as it is easier to scale the aesthetics up than down."
1663,"The purchase of the S3 for my wife a couple weeks ago may have accelerated my plans for the Mazda3 being a fun ""in-between"" car."
1664,I received a exemplary comment over the weekend regarding my silver Q50S...the gentleman was early-20's.
1665,"I recently stumbled upon a 335is which had to be custom ordered; CWP is the only option. No DCT, leather, Comfort Access, navigation, or H-K. The perfect E91 for me."
1666,And?
1667,for those talking caddy and messing with pricing you are spot on - the ELR is a perfect example of it- car is a rebadged Chevy and is 70k - I would bet I will never see another one
1668,"Well, there is probably a decent separation between ELR and Volt in terms of almost everything, but motor.  However, it still does not get you to 70 grand."
1669,My guess is that he was thinking that he was about the get the biggest payday of his life. I bet he's making several times what he used to make at Audi.
1670,I whole heartedly agree.  Anyone who has ever had a car where reliability and durability caused great and frequent concern will always be very concerned with reliability and durability.
1671,"The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease.  Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."
1672,"I wouldn't be so sure that Audi, BMW, or Benz is much more reliable than Focus RS.  It might, but it might not."
1673,"I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around.  They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers.  They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact.  Change your name, don't use any letters from your previous name (OK; Ally uses the A in GMAC; vowels will be forgiven).  So think up a name that doesn't have the letters ""GM"" or ""Cdllc"" in it!"
1674,"I agree, if Ford is smart, they'll ensure the Focus RS is reliable and durable.  If they don't give a damn, well, anything is possible.  I guess my main point is I'd be worried (and I think others out there too) about the reliability and support of a nearly $40K Ford whereas with Audi they've already gained my trust, and others probably feel the same way given Audi's recent growth.   I'd probably be worried about it with Benz too, a bit less so with BMW.  Part of the reason is BMW offers free maintenance for a long time.   The other part is I see a lot of BMW's at HPDE sessions/events and they don't seem to require tow trucks or early retirements during the weekend."
1675,Over at vtec.net iutodd has compiled a list of luxury sales for the year so far:
1676,"Well, GM knows not how to use pricing in their favor for cars...for trucks, yes.  They really aren't a car company anymore and Caddy is the proof they really struggle with that lost ""standard""."
1677,The only thing going into a ditch in the immediate future will be a number of Cadillac dealers. Heads are going to  roll pretty soon I think.
1678,"Looking at the numbs above Buick jumps off the charts a bit- with that being said remember when gm cut the brand - lost Pontiac and 2 other brands that sucked. Ford sacked Mercury, Christler the worst of the bunch got rid of Plymouth and struggled only to be sold for pennies. The anticipation of a potential slowdown ... The problems with unions... The financial crisis bout to happen ... The end of the good old giveaways at dealerships.  gM has to smarten up. Slice a brand or 2 if needed....toyota prob will beat them to the punch again"
1679,"Absolutely and I said this in these forums during the BK. The GM fans would still have bought the newly renamed GM, and the GM non-fans would be MUCH more likely to buy a vehicle from a revamped company that wasn't named GM. Remember Valujet? They renamed to AirTran and became quite successful until bought by Southwest, in spite of a bad crash and maintenance problems. The name change wiped a lot of the memory away."
1680,"It's not just reliablity, it is also parts costs and dealer costs. While Ford's reliability has been pretty poor lately, even a more reliable German car could easily cost more, especially if you are out of your warranty period."
1681,"Yes. It seems like some Cadillac dealers are literally begging for mercy. And it seems like they're not getting any. I imagine that low volume dealers in smaller cities have helped enlarge Cadillac's overall numbers for decades. But now management might look down at those dealers, which might not be glitzy, and might not have customers who can pay prices higher than BMW's for today's Caddys."
1682,"Precisely; besides, the RS will only be built in Der Fatherland!!!"
1683,"I wouldn't call Buick a luxury brand. And so, taking it out, here are the top 10 luxury makes in sales this year so far. The top 3 are quite close. I think it's possible any of them could pull out a narrow win for first place. Despite its big successes, it's a long drop to Audi, and then Acura is not far behind."
1684,This is the fantasy that Johan de Nysschen has sold to GM:
1685,"Wow -- well, like they say, ""aim for the stars."""
1686,"Cadillac is going to have to excel in the entry level luxury segment--traditional Cadillac buyers are simply not responding to Cadillacs high end price structure.  Cadillac is hoping they will ""in time"" but how much time does Cadillac have?"
1687,"It's going to take a lot more than a new advertising agency to help Cadillac. IMHO the brand, like GM and Chevrolet, is tainted by a lot of history. They should rebrand themselves completely."

Can't figure why heated seats don't come standard in the base model, though.  The S has brought me the sport suspension/brakes even though AWD and the sport mode tightens up the trans shifts quite nicely.  I chose the non-DAS steering.  Very nice package for $455/month lease, indeed.  Love the blip-throttle downshift, also."
1690,"I love the way the Q50 S looks with those 19"" wheels and lip spoiler.  However, the higher trim package coupled with the absolutely horrendous road conditions here in the North East would steer me towards the base model.  I follow the ""lease questions"" board here and am amazed at how cheap these cars lease for compared to their MSRP."
1691,"I agree the lease deals are great on the Q.  I originally shopped a used G37S RWD but before I could blink, it was gone!  Hard to find in stock RWD S models here in NJ."
1692,I can chime in here. Two things - he was part of the GM failed management team and was always making excuses for their mediocre-to-shoddy vehicles.
1693,2 recent road trips 800 total miles mostly highway I have gotten a combined 29mpg. s4 25k miles. Car does a lot well.
1694,"Sween, my S4 does similarly -- better than the 2.0T I had (2009)."
1695,Most of today's turbo motors can achieve respectable mpg numbers assuming that they are matched with a vehicle with appropriate gearing. My Mazdaspeed averages north of 28 mpg if I keep cruise speeds under 80- that's with a tuned 2.3 liter making about 320 hp.
1696,"This AWD Q50S is averaging 26 mpg highway/21 all around (keeping at 75 mph cruising).  Not great but acceptable for a 3,700 lb. sled."
1697,"Agreed, but the S4 is not turbo charged, rather it is super charged which ought to be less efficient one would think."
1698,"Well, yes and no; an SC engine uses some of the power the SC produces to operate the SC, but a turbo motor may-MAY-have more exhaust backpressure than a NA or SC motor."
1699,"So Lexus did what I figured it would do, it has replaced the weak 2.5l V6 out of the IS250 and is using a modified version of the NX200 turbo 4. This past year when looking at SUV's we test drove a NX200 and wasn't all that impressed with the power it had, we both felt the BMW X3 felt faster.. The article I'm posting does not post 0-60 times.."
1700,"Certainly not surprising that Lexus is finally offering a 4 cyl turbo to compete with the other makes.  I do find it kinda bizarre that it will only be RWD, and the base AWD offering will be a de-tuned version of the V6."
1701,"Good to know.  With my wife's recent S3 acquisition, it has me thinking of a used S4 or S5."
1702,Sales of some entry-level lux models for July:
1703,The ATS sales are particularly disappointing.
1704,"If you get a chance to read the new Road & Track opinion page by Bob Lutz, ""Go Lutz Yourself,"" I highly encourage you to do so."
1705,"Maximum Bob's words are to be taken with a grain of salt, imho."
1706,"The new boss of Cadillac seems close to crazy to me. He thinks he can charge prices above BMW? Caddy seems to be in free fall. Sad. Although that has seemingly allowed a make I like better, Acura, to pass Cadillac, which I never thought I'd see...."
1707,ELR ... a rare sighting.
1708,"Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes.  ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either."
1709,"In luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. It's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't.  Others may have something similar, but not the same.  This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options.  BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines)."
1710,"I think some of what he said made sense, though. My takeaway was that he feels today's pay structure in automotive should favor the designer above all else. All of the efforts by the CEOs and CFOs pale in comparison to the effects the designers have on sales."
1711,"Bob Lutz was a part of the spineless management of the old GM and even today he still wouldn't take any responsibility.  I saw him on Kudlow couple of years ago, asked why didn't GM change its ways before.  He responded that UAWs strike fund would outlast their cash pile.  I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"".  GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right.  They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s.  Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union.  But that would have been uncomfortable.  Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while.  Who wants that, if you can pretend that nothing is wrong, do couple of faces to the cameras, like you are fighting those unions, then sign whatever they bring you and collect the bonus for a ""great job""."
1712,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early.  A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one?"
1713,"Agreed - CTS price move should have taken several increments, not one big leap.  Hubris?  Miscalculation?   I wonder if they asked anybody who isn't their relative or on their payroll.  To me even a 12-year-old kid could have told them it was a bad idea.  Those corporate echo chambers are just like cable news shows - everybody nodding and reinforcing each other how smart they all are (which is obvious, as they all agree).  Then the reality strikes - elections for one, or sales of others.  Brilliant theories fall apart - but of course, nobody admits to anything, they all have ready twenty-five excuses, why people who voted against them didn't really mean it, or why people who bought something else were somehow duped."
1714,"I wonder if it would have been any different had they simply named the ATS the new CTS and come up with a different name for what is now the CTS. Of course, then people would be up in arms that the CTS shrunk. Oh well."
1715,"I think, too, there is merit in the observation that Cadillac doesn't have enough CUV's to compete with the likes of Audi and BMW.  And, despite my own rejection of the notion of buying an X6 when I could have an even better equipped X5 were I to spend X6 money, well, BMW has the X1,X3,X4,X5 & X6 and some ""M"" variations to spice things up even more.  Cadillac has what, an Escalade?"
1716,"Actually, Lincoln is now making a come back. Sales were up a solid 21% for Lincoln in July. They had their best July sales of the last 10 years. Lincoln is a ""value"" luxury brand. If they keep it up, and Caddy continues their misguided free fall, they might someday trade places in the sales rankings. This is actually a big opportunity for Lincoln for ""conquest"" sales from their long-time competitor."
1717,"As I've said before, Cadillac should have taken the Lexus route and priced their cars on the low side and only raise prices as the cars gained exposure and accolades."
1718,"Wonder if De Nysschen sometimes looks back at leaving Audi and thinks to himself, ""What in the wide-wide world of sports was I thinking?"" He was with Audi for 19 years and things were going along swimmingly weren't they?"
1719,"WOW...interesting article.  Ikeda is the right guy for the job.  But, it's rare to see someone resign (get fired?) after several successful product launches and accelerating volumes like Accavitti did."
1720,"I became a convert when the auto versions surpassed their manual counterparts in speed. I prefer pretty much anything that improves performance. I'm not completely converted, however, as I believe the majority of automatics are still inferior to their manual counterparts. There is no way in hell I would have bought a Fit with the CVT trans, for example. It also took alot of convincing to make the switch. I test drove the 135i with ZF 6-speed 3 times before coming to the conclusion that I could live with it. I grew to love it. (not the car, but the trans)"
1721,"Like you, I tend to own the cars that I drive exclusively for a"
1722,I read somewhere the Mustang GT was equal to the M3 in just about every way as far as performance goes.
1723,"Edmunds gives Acura its ""Best Retained Value Award"" out of all luxury brands:"
1724,"Despite Cadillac being displaced in sales by Acura, I am rooting for Cadillac and I do think they have the guy to turn the thing around assuming that he gets some of the credit for his 19 year tenure at Audi.  Not sure why he left Infiniti, my guess is he wanted to live in New York City, not Hong Kong, but, I assume only he knows the full story."
1725,"If anyone was unhappy with their A4/S4 Q5/SQ5 A5/S5's Audi connect feature due to the limitations of the T-Mobile network (here in River City at least), my dealer loaned me an AT&T SIMM chip and coded my MMI to point to AT&T rather than T-Mobile and voila!  I am full-time in 3G and typically with at least 3 bars."
1726,"But they declared themselves ""fixed"" after the bailout, so now they decided they could charge more for ""equal"" car.  Essentially, ""get 5 contender for the price of 3"" is not working is a luxury/upscale world.  That's downmarket commodity ""more for less"" world.  The luxury world is ""more for even more"", Cadillac thought they could enter that as ""equal"".  They problems is it doesn't work that way.  They should have crept the price over time, rather than slamming such a big hike at once.  Unless they were prepared for the volumes to crash and thought ATS would take care of that (it did not over longer time)."
1727,"Hey Mark - with regard to your statement above, don't you still need to have a data plan with regard to the Wi-Fi hotspot in the car?"
1728,"I think I answered my own question with a little research on audiusa.com.  So the wi-fi is just one of the features bundled with ""Audi Connect,"" available as a subscription cost."
1729,premium sales for June of 2015
1730,"Well, as I understand it the Boss 302 would give the E3x M3 all it could handle(no pun intended) and the 2015 GT PP is just as fast-or faster-than the Boss. I'd give the current M3/4 a slight edge for now- but all bets are off when the GT350 and GT350R arrive."
1731,"With Audi Connect you pay a certain price, based on the number of pre-paid months you opt for, and you get unlimited data.  You can use a PC in wifi mode and up and down load attachment laden emails without limit as to the plan."
1732,"Over at Acurazine, some drivers are reporting 38-40 mpg on the hwy with the V-6 TLX, which is quite a bit above the EPA rating. Surprising, but I guess it makes sense, because at 70 mph typically half of the V-6 engine is shut off with VCM. The result is that you're running a 3 cylinder car with the 9 speed transmission at c. 1500 rpm."
1733,"I would have to assume the BMW M3 would be the champ in that comparo.  But, since there is no RS4 other than the avant, I see the logic of selecting an RS3."
1734,Ford claims GT350R Mustang matches Porsche 911 GT3 lap time
1735,"I think the goal was to show that the M3 is not the end all of sports sedans ad that it could be ""beaten"" by a lowly Civic."
1736,What am I doing wrong? I click on that and it shows me a video of the Type R vs a couple of European hatches.
1737,"I don't know, maybe go to the AE home page and access it from there."
1738,Go to
1739,ok. thanks.
1740,"Here is an article about the new Ford GT350R, on paper it sound like a champ, the flat plain crank should give it a unique sound over the Camero SS."
1741,Of course a lot of things look good on paper...
1742,"Based on Ford's recent track record with their performance cars(Mustang GT PP, Boss 302, Fiesta?Focus ST) I would be extremely surprised if the GT350R wasn't a world class high performance car."
1743,"I think you should get yourself some quick and agile dwarf car, like a Mini or Fiat Abarth. I find cars like these so much easier to drive in traffic and if you equip them correctly, they aren't the least bit spartan. Unfortunately, not cheap either."
1744,"Well, for that matter, I could probably go all the way down to a Smart car -- but, still not sure how even that would allow me to keep moving when the rest of the folks were at a virtual stand still.  Besides, I drove a mini and they aren't exactly what I would call ""quick."""
1745,"For some reason BMW will not offer the sport suspension on X drive cars, so the sport package and M Package are just appearance packages, however, if you do get a X drive car you get the DHP (Dynamic Handeling Package) which the Adaptive suspension is part of and will take care of the suspension problem. Ricks GT will have the DHP, since all GT's are xDrive here in the states."
1746,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life.  As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive.  Hence the ""con"".  There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western).  Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive.  Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines.  The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls.  The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault)."
1747,Let's start with...I've never seen the BMW 3 gt - the 5 gTs that I've seen all look dumpy and for some reason the ones I've seen have smaller 18 inches where 19/20s should be in place. It's a cool concept which seem more at place in the 3- but let's be honest given the choice...
1748,"The 3-GT is on a longer wheelbase than the 3-series sedan, supposedly to accommodate the Chinese market. Many owners are driven."
1749,There is 3 inch more leg room in the back and the car is 1 inch wider then a 3 series sedan. The amount of leg room in the back is more then a 5 series sedan. The 5 GT has more leg room in the back then a standard WB 7 series.
1750,"of the cars with 4/5 doors - if you had to vote one off the island, legroom aside it would be the GT every time. If I had to drive my 7 foot grandmother around it would be in the GT."
1751,"I agree, GT is not really a BMW in the same way other cars.  I liked the general idea, but the execution was in a wrong direction.  Now, 4-series Grand Coupe looks fantastic and hits all the right tones - 440i GC (when it comes in 2017) is most likely going to be my next car - unless I decide I can't wait and get 435i GC."
1752,"I have given up trying to keep the BMW models straight. Confusing nomenclature, and seemingly ton of overlap between them."
1753,"Grand Coupe is a 4-series because it uses 4-series wheelbase and wheeltrack.  It also has a rear hatch, which is a hoot to me.  I won't buy a car without a rear hatch.  The sloped rear is a downer for 6-ft tall individuals in the back seat, but I don't care - I sit in the front and don't chauffeur anybody around."
1754,"Yeah, if only it were so easy to remember ...."
1755,"For anyone interested, I posted my driving impression of the 2016 STI in the"
1756,"What's not to like about the STI.  You should like it.  I guess there is one thing, you are forced to get a sedan rather than have the option to get the hatch version like the good ol' days."
1757,"Yes, I would prefer a hatch."
1758,Have you test driven the Golf R?  I've heard reports that in real world driving it is faster than the STI.
1759,"I'd like to try a Golf R, but they are extremely thin on the ground. The local VW dealers can also be jerks- that quells my enthusiasm a bit."
1760,"That is very true about them being thin on the ground.  And VW dealers seem content to markup sticker if they can get away with it, yet they sell anyway.    As to VW dealers being jerks, that's the rumour and the reputation.   The dealers I went to in So Cal (3 different dealers) were all reasonably accommodating and didn't seem abnormal.   Of course, 2 of the dealerships were owned by the same company."
1761,"An interesting bit on the Q is the tire pressure monitor.  It shows the air pressure in each tire.  You can see the pressure rise as the tires warm.  Cool to start, typically rises from 35 - ~ 40 psi."
1762,Many cars have this.  I do the same on my Acura.
1763,"I'm now on an Ohio BMW dealer's email list because they had a 135is I was interested in(before I came to my senses, but I digress). Anyway, today they sent me an email announcing that they were leasing 2015 320i xDrive sedans for $299-$399 per month- for 36 months with $0 down(10k mile/year). Not a car I'd ever consider, but it does sound like a decent deal for someone who'd want something like that."
1764,Local dealer here in Denver has them for $299 with $1799 down. Not enough miles for me and just a bit beyond my budget.
1765,"On the comment above - I'm amazed dealers would markup ""hot"" cars and not just go with msrp. Seems like a dangerous game to play as they can piss off customers. If dealers Are really into satisfying customers for more then one car sale- if I went into a dealership and wanted a certain car (like I did years ago looking for an accord v6 couple, manual) and they up priced said car - I would never go back (which I didn't a few years later to get my wife's crv, but I did use there discounted price to get a better deal elsewhere)"
1766,"Dealers are simply striking while the iron is hot .. folks are willing to pay above sticker for the new hot thing. First generation Miata, PT Cruiser, GT-R are examples that come to mind."
1767,"I colleague of mine had pre-ordered a BMW i8 to the tune of about $200k.  Much later when the car came in they demanded an additional $50k over the MSRP.  He was incensed because this was non-negotiable, and they would not even compromise, plus he had to exert considerable pressure on them to get his deposit back.  They definitely lost him as a repeat customer.  He had been a repeat customer up till then."
1768,A few dealers pulled the same stunt with the Z8 and 1 Series M Coupe.
1769,"I get they are ""striking, while hot"" but the next car a guy Who is now looking golf gti might be looking in 3/4 years time for a Passat or some suv - mainstream dealers are about volume- seems short sided to me."
1770,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?"
1771,Jon Ikeda promoted to General Manger of Acura:
1772,"The alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty."
1773,"I have to disagree.  The new A3 left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" Audi.  I liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though.  The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for).   Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving)."
1774,"There is a VW S3, but it's called the Golf R and has 5 doors.  The dealer that had one in my County didn't have it sitting more than a couple days before it disappeared into some happy buyer's garage.  Most VW dealers have zero.  Maybe the Golf 400 will be more readily available."
1775,"In Texas, us old folks call tires ""casin's"" (casings)."
1776,"The ""casin"" is the thing that you retread if it's a truck tire (max of twice), at least in my world.  Retreads on the drive axles only."
1777,"What's with H-rated standard tires. When I bought my A4 in 1998, new, with sport package, it came with Z-rated Pirellis."
1778,"well, I can live with H, since I rarely get my car up over 130!"
1779,Top speed rating category doesn't give the full picture of the performance capabilities a tire will help your ELLPS or LPS car attain.
1780,"I live in the San Diego Southern California region where snow is extinct and rain is rare.  I am still running stock 245/40R18 (Pirelli P7's Z-rated speed) Summer tires on my OEM wheels and will soon be trying 255/40R18 Extreme Performance Bridgestone RE-71's on my aftermarket 18"" wheels that are a 1/2"" wider than stock (and several pounds lighter).  Not because it is summer season, but because anytime a track event looms on the future horizon, I can just switch out, but I enjoy the extra performance on roads too, and not having to buy tools or spend time swapping them out myself at the track.  I think the stock Pirelli's fall under Max Performance, but they are just OK for the times.  They'll be replaced with Michelin Pilot Super Sports when needed."
1781,"I wish, sometimes, that we had SoCal's weather -- but, since we don't, and I am (or at least I must be) a lazy American when it comes to changing tires for Summer and Winter, I will continue with the best possible UHP A/S's that money can buy (based on the research and comments from folks here and on the TireRack's site.)"
1782,Tires (mark brought it up not me)
1783,we're waiting for the other shoe to drop......AND.....?
1784,"Dedicated summer and winter tire/wheel sets are definitely the optimum setup. That's what I run on the Club Sport, 328i, and MS3. The TJ and X3 run all seasons year round, but note that the Jeep's A/S tires also have the Severe Snow(winter) rating."
1785,"Roadburner:  Perhaps a bit of a word game, on my part, but I would say dedicated summer and winter tires are the MAXIMUM setup not the optimum.  UHP A/S are optimal, just not the maximum you can achieve."
1786,"I'm a big fan of dedicated snow tires, too.  If you pitted a RWD or FWD car with dedicated snows against an AWD car with all seasons, it'd be pretty close. The AWD would probably be better on gaining traction for acceleration, but in steering, braking and handling I think the 2WD would beat it every time."
1787,If you live where there is routinely
1788,"I prefer two sets of tires and wheels even on AWD cars.  AWD + winter tires = awesome.  The other reason I like 2 sets is I like summer tires.  If I get summer tires I need something else for winter, so I might as well do it right and get winter tires.  Around here (Chicago) the snow isn't usually too bad, so I prefer performance winter tires unless it's a RWD car.  They're much better on roads that aren't covered in snow than something like a T-rated snow and ice tire."
1789,"As a life-long New Englander and skier of the beautiful Green and White mountains, beyond choice in drive wheels and/or tires, I find a major factor in handling driving in the snow is the fact that many drivers are just not that bright."
1790,Love the tire talk and good to hear others are going the 2 set/season route - the cars we drive today have a boatload of safety tech built in but have added weight and power which can cripple you in a tough situation.
1791,"This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars.  I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position.  European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions.  Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels.  Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process.  Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines.  This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc.  Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug)  lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK.  This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics."
1792,"Dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. Do we really need a 120K MB S600? Doesn't a 60K Lexus LS460 give the same ride and comfort? Just because you don't see a need for a diesel power Jetta doesn't mean others do not. Currently here in phoenix diesel fuel is roughly .30 cents less then regular unleaded"
1793,"That's true, to each their own.  My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great,  but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment.  Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story.  The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal.  Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop.  It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."
1794,"I found a couple of CPO E92 335i manuals while car hunting- both had xDrive, unfortunately."
1795,It's just weight + complexity. What's not to like?
1796,"Plus, you don't even get a sport suspension. Most FXX cars at least offer the option of an adaptive suspension with xDrive. Without it the cars have a floaty ride and even more understeer."
1797,<at transition.
1798,"Cool...thanks!  Appreciate the offer, but I've already got my BMW ""guy"" locally."
1799,"So to say that you are a little bias towards BMW, but to set the record straight, BMW does not import the 335d any longer, the 328d was it's replacement. If you want a wagon, it's either 328i or 328d."
1800,"Maybe.  Gas mileage so far 21 mixed driving.  Sounds real nice on the down shifts. NVH is better than than previous iteration, IMHO."
1801,"We have a Q50 Hybrid with 34k on the clock.  It's a great car, but the best description I've heard is ""Infiniti couldn't decide if they wanted to build a luxury car or a sports car, and they ended up with neither"""
1802,I'd agree completely. Not a track day car but neither was the '06 330XI bimmer!
1803,"There is no 335d for F30 model in the US market.  It was only E90 and IMHO that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335)."
1804,"I should have known the 335d was gone, but after 32 years of BMW ownership and CCA participation my interest in the marque has decreased significantly; a couple of weeks ago I found last month's"
1805,"Is that the case?  I went to the UK site to see and they offer in the diesel 316, 318, 320, 325, 330, 335.  No where could I find the actual engine size.  Does BMW actually make 6 different diesels in those sizes?"
1806,"To confirm it, you need to look up the UK specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d US version (I did it for German version)."
1807,"The 335d was a test car for BMW, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, E38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque. It would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. That would take care of the power problem."
1808,"I'll back Dino, our 328d is the euro 320d, same engine.. If they all use the same 2 liter, then it is all about tune.. Just like the our 320 and 328i."
1809,"That's right.  However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size.  Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification.  However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick.  Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy.  Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end  (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world."
1810,"True but BMW has been playing the current badge = what the old engine performance used to do.  So the 335 has a 2.8 but it performs like the old 3.5.  It's definitely about ""prestige."""
1811,"335 has 3.0, not 2.8, but the point is the same.  Now it will become 340.  Same size (3.0), more ponies so now (according to them) it is now like old 4.0 V8.  To a degree, it's true, but c'mon.  Now Benz is doing the same with their models.  C300 has 2.0 I4, C400 has a 3.5 V6, etc."
1812,"C'mon is correct - especially for us OCD guys.  I feel the need to get a bunch of plastichrome numbers and ""fix"" all those cars.  Then Zen will be achieved."
1813,It's easier to just take the numbers off..
1814,On the s4 for summers I have continentals extream contacts- 19's 255/35 big boys - I can say it's night and day over the 18' winters and with the SD pushing it into a Turn is pure joy.
1815,Hey wait a minute- I am having fun too.
1816,"(whispering) Pure Joy.  I can only imagine since I don't have the SD, but my wife and I took out an S5 w/SD recently -- it too had the 19"" wheel/tire package -- and it gave new meaning to the phrase ""corners like a snake in a rat hole."""
1817,"Interesting I may try that- I do 40/40 all round - I don't feel the heavy front could be the SD but I would prob have to drive a regular side by side to comp. When I was looking I test drove one w/o SD and found it handle really well- it was set up with summer 19' slicks as well and I loved it, just couldn't match up on price. Mark Thanks for the talk on tires - when I swapped mine I was told this is the last summer on current set. Winters on the other hand have another couple of seasons- let's hope we (up east) don't have a similar winter or it will be less. This car really is a all purpose beast - in the snow with proper shoes (marks term) it's a billy goat- in the summer with slicks and in beast mode it's a rocket that can handle turns- not bad for a stealth kid hauler."
1818,"I run summer tires on my Club Sport and Mazdaspeed; I have a set of UHP all seasons that I use as winter rubber for the MS3, but the Club Sport just remains in the heated garage when the ambient temperature drops much below 30F."
1819,Heated garage wow is that's treating the cars right
1820,"We have a walk-out basement, so there was room for a two-car garage as well."
1821,Junes sales for entry level midsize lux-performance sedans:
1822,June sales for smaller lux-performance:
1823,"Wow, Audi is really kicking butt with the A3.  Interesting how I found my '06 A3 superior in many ways to the current model, though Americans prefer their sedans to ""sportbacks"" as Audi put it.  The sales numbers show that."
1824,tlong...makes sense.
1825,"The S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor!   It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation.  If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K."
1826,"I agree with your assessment.  In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX.   Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced."
1827,"I can report the Q50 V-6 is one of the best engines I've experienced, even nicer than the I-6 in the 330XI that I leased back in'06.  Granted, the supension, road feel and the intuitive qualities of the beemer still linger but the Q ia a very nice ride!"
1828,"""Beemer/"" You can't get a six in any configuration from BMW Motorrad..."
1829,Why are sales so dismal?
1830,"tlong....one thing you might want to do is drive the TLX. If refinement is at the top of your list, you might be pleasantly surprised by a test drive....especially the V6 SH AWD version."
1831,Ok- you went from a RWD inline six to FWD 4CYCL-and you are pleased- explain.
1832,"One thing you've probably already thought of is that few brands beyond Acura are likely to give you the 10 or so years of very reliable service that you've had with your TL. If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today.  A loaded Audi A3 might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable TLX."
1833,"VQ egine from Nissan has won many awards but the biggest issue is, horrible MPG, Harshness in the upper range and not very refine towards redline.  Now according to you the VQ is a better engine then the inline 6 from BMW, but motor journalist from around the world would say you are wrong.."
1834,Glad you are happy with your Q50.  I see quite a few of them on the road and like them.
1835,"Roadburner, who has been on these boards for, lo, these many years, did a similar thing.  He seems to enjoy his Mazda quite a lot, even though he's owned (and still does) several BMWs.  Perhaps he will chime in."
1836,Really?  I didn't interpret it that way at all.  I read it as everyone is different and you should drive what floats their boat and not have to feel bad about it.  Maybe I'm wrong.
1837,"Roadburner, who has been on these boards for, lo, these many years, did a similar thing.  He seems to enjoy his Mazda quite a lot, even though he's owned (and still does) several BMWs.  Perhaps he will chime in."
1838,"Well, I don't know how much you want me to go into it."
1839,I buy whatever makes me smile. The badge or model number is never a factor. I don't judge the goodness of a car by the number of envious glances it generates or how well it telegraphs my disposable income to other motorists.
1840,"Andres, thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'm inclined to spend that much for the S4 although I'm sure I would enjoy it. Also isn't the A4 due for a redesign in a year or so? I'm curious to see what changes. Unfortunately I'm sure it will go up in price some more."
1841,"Breld, thanks for the suggestion and I would be interested in your thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to post a lengthy story."
1842,"I sort of liked the ILX. It was nice and all but actually the car I really used to like was the original TSX, before they bloated it up. I had those as loaners a few times and liked the interior, size, and agility. The ILX is nice but the styling inside and out isn't motivating me. I'm sure they are good reliable cars which would be the plus, but I'm thinking not very sporty. Honda/Acura seems to have lost that sportiness that they had in the 80s and 90s."
1843,"Roadburner, who has been on these boards for, lo, these many years, did a similar thing.  He seems to enjoy his Mazda quite a lot, even though he's owned (and still does) several BMWs.  Perhaps he will chime in."
1844,"I was initially looking at a GTI back in 2007, but the local VW dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&T"
1845,"The V6 SH AWD ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. Whatever additional tuning is performed on the SH AWD ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an S4) -- and it is not (or perhaps I should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential."
1846,"Mark...I concur with you.  SH AWD, even in the TLX, is a ""horse of a different color"".  While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects."
1847,"One of the things about the Q50 that I noticed -- having come from an FX with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other Japanese and Germans lack.  Now, having said that, the 3.7L motor in the Q50 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side."
1848,"For MY16 a similar options 340i is less then a MY15 335i. On the 340i LED headlights are now standard, BMW has shifted many items around, option packages have changed,"
1849,"FN...looked for the 340 on TrueCar last night.  They don't have it listed yet.  I would imagine the lack of discounts on them is still going to put it above where I would want to budget a car/if I get a new car.  I mentioned before, I like these new turbo 4 motors. They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse.  BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS)."
1850,And another car is coming to play in the 3 series field... Welcome the
1851,"The BMW build for the 340 should go live very soon, since the factory that makes the 3 series closes down for 2 weeks starting tomorrow, so people can't order a new 335 any longer, so check back middle of next week, also I can put you in contact with some sales people who will sell the car at invoice +$500, order your car, then pick it up at the PDC (Performance Delivery Center in South Carolina, and have a day learning how to drive fast, then take delivery of your new BMW and drive it home."
1852,"If you bought the S4 to hold it's value you made a big mistake. I have 30K on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a Dodge Dart. Since your S4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."
1853,"Well,  I'd have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles.  She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try).  Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible."
1854,According to the small claims judge the accident's diminished value was only worth $3K
1855,"I think your priorities are askew, the accident will be the big issue not your miles when you go and sell it."
1856,"I guess I always figured that unless somebody was leasing, I bought the car so I might as well enjoy it. I keep my cars a long time so I don't worry about limiting my miles, I intend to use the car to the maximum. Currently at 152K on my '05 Acura TL and will probably keep it another year or so. I would say drive the car and enjoy it (the S4) and don't worry about resale value unless that is something critical to you."
1857,"I agree, I'm an Audi buyer and I wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole.  Not without a big steep discount.  Luckily I can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle).  The problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the history books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter."
1858,"Appreciate the input you and others here have given.  I guess life is too short to drive a 140 HP Civic EX Sedan 65+ miles a day over a 333 HP (underrated stock number) S4 Sedan.   Of course, I don't have much fun doing the typical route on the freeway being stuck behind mind numbing traffic.   However, as I've previously mentioned; I've found a very fun route home that doesn't cost much extra time but most definitely costs me extra fuel, brakes and tires.   I'll trade the fun for brakes, gas, and tires though; it's worth it."
1859,"tlong....I know you mentioned you will keep your TL for another year, but have you started looking around yet? If so, what are you looking at?"
1860,"So after some time, we ordered Ricks new BMW, 2016 328xi GT, Imperial Blue w/ Oyster Interior. European Delivery date at The Welt Aug 28th. Spending 11 days in Europe with the car."
1861,"that sounds nice.  the car, and the trip!"
1862,Enjoy the car & the trip!  We want a full write up upon your return;)
1863,FN...cool....wanna hear all about it when you return!
1864,"Well, I'm underwhelmed by some of the cars out these days. While I could afford a quite expensive car it is not in my current desire to spend more than perhaps $35K or so. My preferences are mildly sporty but nicely appointed smaller cars. So I'm thinking either a fully loaded Mazda 3 which handles really well and can have a pretty nice interior; or perhaps a used C-class. I don't find the Bimmers nice enough inside for my tastes. I'm ok with the current A4 but frankly don't want to spend that much - I found my '98 A4 at least as appealing as the current model. And I really lament the scarcity of manual transmissions and that is probably one reason that I'm not overly motivated by a lot of the available choices. I might consider something like a VW GTI but I'm not inclined to deal with VW and their parts and service again. I find the current Jetta a bore-fest."
1865,"It is funny that you say that.  I feel the same way:  ""underwhelmed"" by not just some, but a lot of cars out there these days.  Nothing jumps out at me in the looks or driving department that makes me start thinking about how long until I'm even or have equity on the loan of my Subaru.  I look at the price I paid for my Subaru, the features it has that I really like (AWD, Heated Seats) and also what my monthly payment is.  No my car isn't perfect, it could use more giddyup.  I look at different cars and say to myself, OK this is nice, but not worth $X thousand more than my Legacy and definitely not worth $X more per month."
1866,"I don't know about that ... didn't that iteration of the TL have 225 HP? The Mazda, in ""s"" trim, has 185 HP. And, the power to weight ratio might be pretty similar."
1867,"tlong....good points.  Only for a different reason, I keep crossing off cars off my list that might be interesting, but could be potentially a hassle to own.  My CTS comes immediately to mind.  Good looking.  Has all the ""right stuff"".  But, just a nightmare to own."
1868,"One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside."
1869,"Funny how we all have different tastes in vehicles. The wife really likes her A3 even better than her old Mazda3s which she really liked. As to being cheap inside, seems fine to us but it's the most expensive vehicle we've ever owned and our first German make...to be honest, if I had the funds, I would've gotten one instead of my Golf but feel like I got a 2/3 A3 right now. The smaller size of both vehicles was a major reason for purchasing what we did as we both like a small vehicle and we both got what we wanted here! Reliability wise, her A3 has been stellar unlike my Golf with 2 unplanned dealer visits in 5 months...can't blame the rims/tires issue on them really as I wanted the swap in the first place. Driving near the VW store this morning, saw the TDI wheels I originally wanted and still a bit pissed that they didn't listen to me but like what they substituted as I only see them on Jetta SEL models."
1870,tlong....have you looked at the 4 cyl TLX?  Would that hit your budget?
1871,How is it a nightmare to own?
1872,Those of us who populate other boards will advise you to bring a notebook and lunch.
1873,"Think all the Big 3 stereotypical owner experiences everyone always harps on the Big 3 about and many think is   history but for some it is still current events and news.  Breaking news.   Is it 2015 or 1995?  His CTS is outgunning my Neon right now for Lemon of the Century.  At least my Neon didn't become a complete lemon until after year 3 was over by 1 day.  Even worse when I hit 36,000 miles probably just before year 4.   That being said, it did need to be towed the first morning after it's first night in the garage at home.  For balance, Dodge never told me they couldn't fix it."
1874,"How's the mileage with the TDI?  Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife.  It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather."
1875,I can see it now - in 40 years:
1876,I must have missed something since I haven't seen GG post anything but glowing reviews of his CTS.
1877,You can go over to buying and selling cars and go back about 500 comments to find the beginning of the story or send him a message directly to get his story.
1878,"Perhaps when I mentioned cheap inside, I'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis."
1879,"I did sit in the TLX and ILX recently in the showroom. I was surprised to feel that the TLX is really not so different in size or style than my '05 TL - a full 10 years older! The shapes are familiar, the interior still looks familiar, with the expected tarting up of LEDs, different fascias, bumpers, etc. My TL is like 250hp v6 and why would I buy a 4 cyl TLX for the same price or more than I paid for my TL? Too similar for my tastes and although the TL has been a great car, I guess I need a change and the TLX isn't it. I also find the TL/TLX just a bit bigger than I like and I want something a bit smaller and more agile. My TL is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our Mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. I'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. Power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important."
1880,"That small CUV is a Q3 which we had overnight as a loaner -- very very nice -- too bad it is underpowered.  It seems to have the VW 2.0T version, not the Audi 2.0T what with its 220HP and 258lb/ft.  My guess is the Q3 will get the Audi engine SOON.  Of course, then I'd probably complain that it needs the 8-spd, being the kind of guy who is never happy (well, not really, jus' a little bit)."
1881,Don't get your hopes up- look at the new S7.
1882,"Yes, I know -- what a world, what a world.  The only one I ever saw that I thought looked good was Cadillac's ""elevator"" lift screen.  Since ""no one"" never drives their cars with the screens NOT popped up, why aren't they integrated into the dash (like Porsche or the way Audi and BMW used to be?)"
1883,rental situation- unless it's a special trip I'm looking for a deal - why spend extra on a car you don't own....:go mark- if I had a choice or renting a charger or a mustang / Camaro v6 models I would never go charger - thing looks cool but it's a boat in standard form.
1884,Deep Cover
1885,Mark...asking you this question given how much you love Audi.  Am I reading correctly that the new A4s are dropping HP and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor?  That seems to fly in the face of everything the other ELLPS competitors are doing.
1886,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase.  We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too."
1887,"""My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. """
1888,Volvo has gone to all 4 cyl. based engines now.  Even in the new XC90.
1889,Don't they still leave the option for a turbocharged V6?  I seemed to see a few a couple weeks ago (T6 Drivetrain; AWD).
1890,"Volvo is phasing out the 5 and 6 cyl. engines.  the S60 is in transition, but the new XC90 is all 4 cyl.  Though variations of turbo, supercharged (or both) and electric assist.  so you can get a lot of power out of the little motor!"
1891,For some reason I thought Volvo ceased making cars altogether. Good to hear they are still around and I hope the new interior dash actually has less buttons and more style.
1892,"Two Audis, the S4 and the S8 significantly outperform their MFGR 0-62MPH times -- but the published specs seem to suggest the S3 is, in comparison, the king of the hill next to the S4.  This, my dealer says, will not continue as of the 2017's."
1893,"""I'm at 30K miles on my 2014 S4 -- and I must say, every time I get behind the wheel is better than the time before."""
1894,"My affection for the MS3 was described by an inverted bell curve from around 20k miles to 80k miles- since then I've liked it more and more(especially after I dialed in the suspension to my liking- FSDs, 50% more rear roll stiffness and a set of PSS tires worked wonders)."
1895,Wife's liking her new A3 and it has been flawless.  Got it's first oil change today and they cleaned it up nicely.  Very nice vehicle!
1896,"thanks to his Jetta, my son is firmly hooked on German cars (once you go German, you can't go back!).  Pretty much set that when his lease is up, it will be replaced by something else from the Fatterland.   Maybe a GTI or GLI, but he really has his heart set on an A3 of some sort."
1897,If I do go German again(unlikely) it will almost certainly be a Cayman.
1898,"I don't think I would end up with a German.  GTI probably isn't happening.  I don't see a BMW that would make any sense for us, and I won't buy an Audi."
1899,I am hooked- I cannot/will not go back to Acura- the straight 6 in  the F10 is so sweet.
1900,"I did like, very much, my TL SH-AWD, also liked my wife's Infiniti FX -- the engine in the FX did seem a bit more coarse than something that had an MSRP of $50K ought to have had, however.  Both of us wanted to love our Japanese vehicles.  There was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that"
1901,"My current work commute is over double what it was when I first purchased my S4.  I now have 25,000 miles already!  While you only live once, this kind of mileage is racking up serious depreciation that my frugal side wasn't anticipating.  I think I might have the wife get a new car so I can use her '07 Civic EX sedan as my high mileage beater.   It also gets great gas mileage.   With the saved fuel, maybe I'll spring for the REVO Stage 1+ pulley upgrade kit that takes the S4 to RS4 levels..... and perhaps beyond...."
1902,"You never bought a single thing you knew was inferior to something more expensive, but were to cheap to shell out the money?  A washing machine?  Toaster?  T-shirt?  Shoes?  Couch?  Jacket?  Furniture?  There you go. That's that guy in you.  However, if you truly always buy what you think is best, then you're not from this planet, Mark."
1903,Ooooh -- burned.
1904,"I often look at value.  When comparing the TL-SH-AWD to the S4, I think no one would argue the S4 isn't better, the argument comes in on whether it is 10,000 or 15,000 dollars better.   For me the answer was yes, in my opinion the S4 provided more bang for the buck ""value"" than did the TL.  A lot of shoppers probably go off of value, and if the best product presents a law of diminishing returns, then one might just settle on a lower priced option that isn't as good, but provides better ""value."""
1905,Better is entirely based on your criteria.  And is very subjective.
1906,Don't do it.
1907,Why not just swap cars with the wife?
1908,Dino: I do believe we all pick and choose which
1909,You mostly thought it was great because it was cheap but still had a great feel to the drive.  Makes sense since you like german cars.  VW sales have not been that good as many people do not consider them great at all because repair records and crappy dealer experiences.  At that price point more cars are bought than rented(leased) and people are looking for low maintenance and repair and longevity.  They look at many of the Asian cars for that reason.
1910,"I've heard nothing but good about their stuff, too!"
1911,"As a family that recently bought an Audi and a VW, we are happy with them even though my VW has already had an issue and had to go into the shop. Going in, I knew this could happen so I wasn't too unhappy when they came and let me know they'd be sending me home in a loaner. Today, I tried to charge my cell in the two power plugs and nothing happened, tried multiple chargers and nothing worked so will have to stop over tomorrow and see what's up. Thinking it will be a blown fuse at this point and hope it is...if not, we'll see how they handle it. Must say this kind of issue never happened with our Toyota's, Honda or Hyundai's but again, I knew going in with any VW product that there might be some issues to deal with. And with both the A3 and Golf being first year models, things do happrn!"
1912,"I do like German cars -- but I also liked my Acura TL, often comparing it favorably to an S4. Assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales.  Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative.  Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged."
1913,"Cheap rental for a road trip?   I've done it quite a few times..   If I can get a car for $25/day or less and the mileage is significant, I'm all for it.."
1914,"I rented a Challenger and a Fiat 500 for a couple of trips to see how I liked them. Now granted, the Challenger wasn't an R/T with the STP, and the 500 wasn't an Abarth- but it still gave me a basic idea of what the enthusiast versions would be like..."
1915,"Gotcha.  I never thought of that.  In your case I can understand.  You were able to rent cars you were interested in on the cheap.  In your case it also makes sense because the cars in your stable have over 100K miles on them (no disrespect, I'm sure they could handle the road trip the way you maintain them), but you never know."
1916,"Flight, where was that picture taken?  It looks familiar."
1917,"Mount Arlington, NJ at the Holiday Inn Express off of Howard Blvd."
1918,Not same hotel I stayed at. That would have been odd!
1919,If I get a Challenger it will be either an R/T or an SRT8 with three pedals.
1920,"I'd make a case for at least an RT also, but the V6 Is no slouch.  This one just turned over 100K on the odometer."
1921,"I don't think the standard R/T would ever be enough for me, personally. Scat Pack or nothing. Honestly, though, I have a really hard time navigating the Dodge build page to figure out the differences in models other than engine."
1922,"I'll take a Challenger RT Shaker with the driver convenience group (blind spot warning, rear camera & the better stereo).  6 Speed Stick.  $38K sticker price.  Drooling at what I could get it for with my F & F discount plus USAA plus regular incentives"
1923,"Q, you just got out of the Mustang.  Really want to get back into a Pony (well, more like a Horse, but you get the drift!)"
1924,"well, I was pricing the Charger, not Challenger, but, no, at that price, I would not be interested at all. I didn't pay that much more for my Caddy."
1925,"Granted, the R/T isn't all that fast(0-60 in 5.1 seconds) but I'd think that demo R/T manual I found would be a good deal at around $33k. H-K sound, heated/cooled seats, heated wheel, Super Track Pack, summer tires- nicely equipped, in other words. And Dodge has a few performance pieces that add about 20 hp without affecting the warranty."
1926,"Subaru really needs to either develop a good dual clutch automated transmission unit, or just license the use of Audi/VW version.  Some of us are less then die-hards, and use our ""fun"" vehicle in day to day driving and tremendous high traffic situations which would make using a manual unpleasant at times.   They went from an ancient low efficiency 4-speed automatic to CVT; not exactly progress.  Now when I have the garage space and unlimited bank account I'll have the R8 for weekends and the S4 can be grocery hauler.  If I needed something really big then a Q7 or Toureg would be nice with the 3.0 diesel unit."
1927,Our local VW dealer has a black one.
1928,"I have no complaints about the CVT in my Legacy.  It is smooth, linear, & responsive.  My biggest complaint is the 175 hp engine that the CVT is hooked up to"
1929,"This trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. A very good revenue opportunity.  I am one of the owners of the company and the CEO.  The CTO of the company and I were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy.""  When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in.  Chicago, drive.  Cleveland, drive.  New York, fly.  Nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2K).  We pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car.  The rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""Maxwell House"").  At over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle."
1930,"Business trip is a different story for sure.  My (large) company doesn't even allow it.  Last time I went to our office in VA I decided to drive, and had to rent a car locally."
1931,"I have also driven a 1.8l Jetta on a long trip (sons 2014 SE). It is a nice road car, and can pull excellent MPG."
1932,Hey Mark:
1933,Good grinders and beer as I recall. . . .
1934,"Beer was indeed cold, and the Grinders were indeed good. Can't ask for much more than that. Sat outside looking at the Audis come and go."
1935,"Interesting numbers that show the power of brand equity. BMW may have softer steering but their reputation will take decades to unravel even if they don't spiff up their latest 3-series. Audi is arguably nicer but look at their sales. And the ATS has had many raves for handling but Caddy doesn't have a great reputation (earned by decades of junk) and that's not going to change very quickly, either."
1936,"Cadillac is on the cusp of recovery I think. It takes a car company as long to crawl out of the hole it dug for itself, as it did to dig it in the first place. So if Cadillac went on the skids 1975-1995, then it's about time for a rebirth. But don't count on this company ever reclaiming its former glory from the 1950s. The market has expanded too much and the competition is a lot more fierce.  The ATS and Q40 have to go head to head with some pretty nice cars."
1937,On the car sales data-would love to see the combined sales of both the a4 and a3 - have to think the a3 is gobbling up potential a4 buyers. Car is newer and is close in size.
1938,The CTS should be on the list too.
1939,"CTS 1,792 -38.3%"
1940,"If they can keep it at $50K without stripping it of performance essentials; sounds like a good S4 competitor.  I feel like the C400 and Volvo 60R are just trying to be ""close.""  Then again, I'm not sure I could trust a company that thought merging with Chrysler was a good idea; shows lack of good judgment."
1941,Counter-counterpoint:
1942,I earned a LOL badge today my life is now complete
1943,"My creed has always been ""Don't let great be the enemy of good enough"".  When I worked for a government contractor, we had to continually stress to our design engineers that the customer asked for a Chevy and we shouldn't build a Rolls Royce."
1944,"Well, I think it increasingly looks like Mark is belittling others' choices.  Seems like it's not enough for him that he wouldn't buy Toyota, he doesn't want you buy one, either - because if you do, the world will be in his words ""dumbed down"".  Those who don't care about great handling, but just want an inexpensive, reliable, made well-enough transportation from A to B should get their priorities straightened out, or else."
1945,"It is true, I hope for the stuff we humans produce to be great -- and I would hope everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy everything they experience and have at the highest level possible at a given price point."
1946,"You simply are not going to get a great car, by YOUR definition , for the $20k that a base Camry goes for.  To most of those that buy one I would venture to say they consider it a great car by THEIR definition.  You can feel sorry for them for not recognizing excellence but I doubt they care. Self awareness is a wonderful thing."
1947,"But again, how do you define great?  Some people could not care less how it drives.  Some people see great as super-reliable, low prices and low cost to operate.  That is ""great"" for THEM.  Who are you, sir to define what ""great"" means to THEM?"
1948,"Exactly. I could tell you all the reasons why my Mini Cooper S is a ""great"" car---compact, fast, great on gas, good-looking, room for a 6-footer, plenty of room for basic luggage & carrying stuff, solidly built, really fun to drive, easy to park, the perfect City car.....and yet, put another person in that same car and you might hear:  ""too small...I don't need all that power....I don't like the speedometer in the middle of the dashboard.....rides too hard....expensive to repair...mediocre reliability record....too pricey for such a small car...."""
1949,"Agreed, the same thing is true with home theater equipment, some people are happy as a pig in mud with a 42"" LED and an Insignia HTIB. Others aren't happy unless they have the latest projector,  four subs, and $15k worth of amps and processors. Everyone has their own comfort level as I see it. When I install a HTS for someone the first thing I ask is how much money they want to spend- then I try to find the absolute best components to meet that price point."
1950,"I find this whole discussion funny, I made a comment a week or so ago that, the people who buy Camry's and Accords do so because they like them and they think they are great cars.. So that is who defines them as being great. I like Mark, but the Camry is beneath he and his wife, he has every right not to call the Camry or Accord not great cars."
1951,15K that is a starter kit for most Audiophiles.
1952,"I was patient and bought most of my HTS components when they were discounted ahead of newer models being released. My basement gaming system was really put together on the cheap, picking up an Energy 5.1 system for less than 50% of MSRP and using the speaker cables and HTR from my previous 6.1 system that I replaced when I upgraded my main system to 7.1."
1953,"Certainly true, and so long as you're the only one who knows, it's irrelevant.  However, the ""mine's bigger than yours"" factor also kicks in with a veneance.  Witness many of the posts here and elsewhere."
1954,Jaguar XE vs 335i - Discuss:
1955,"Yes; Peter Aczel calls them the ""Golden-Eared Tweako Cultists""- the folks who think that they can hear a difference between power cables and interconnects that cost upwards of $1K"
1956,"Reminds me of that YouTube video where they gathered hard-core coffee aficionados to do a blind tasting. I thought that when they told the one guy he had picked McDonald's, he was going to commit ritual suicide right then and there."
1957,Funny you should mention that; there have been numerous double-blind tests conducted between different components and interconnects/cables- it seems that no one can hear a difference
1958,"Rockin' DefTech speakers, EMOTIVA pre/pro and dual Epik  ( no longer in business) 18"" subs.  Rolled my own speaker cabling and swear by Monoprice interconnects.  Can't say as i've heard anything to beat it so far.  Half tempted to go the Dolby Atmos , but if it ain't broke, why fix it?"
1959,"Do you all follow the conventional rule of thumb or wisdom that says make your HT budget, then use 50% on speakers, 25% on power/processing, 15% on media/disk player(s), 10% on Cabling/wiring."
1960,I use BJC for all my installations. Excellent stuff.
1961,"I just used my older amp's and pre-amps, and added to it. Counterpoint Amp and Pre-Amp and a tweaked ADCOM amp, I had the CounterPoint equipment re-tubed."
1962,"I suppose there are people who have the skills of discernment in sound equipment equivalent to the skills of discernment practiced by sommeliers, and I suppose the same is true of cars---a highly experienced race driver probably hears and feels things we'd never even guess were there."
1963,"Today, to save some miles and money, I rented a car from Enterprise to drive from Cincinnati to Nashville."
1964,I've heard of Herb....mostly out East.  But. I'd never heard of Moreno until he moved into the Cincinnati area.  He's done well in the short time he's been down this way.
1965,"Moreno was an intern at Automobile magazine and then worked for Saturn.  Chambers hired in as the manager of his Saturn store and Moreno moved up to VP supervising 9 Chambers' locations.  In 2005, MB offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in Cleveland.  Since then he has opened up 30 stores - MB, Porsche, Acura, Lotus, Aston, Infiniti."
1966,"We talked here about Acura losing its way, not more precisely never really making it in this category.  The latest TLX commercial is a perfect example - lack of its own identity seems not enough for them, they had to invoke that idiotic German (catchy, but meaningless) tune.  The visual was actually not bad, but the tune simply idiotic.  They should fire those who authorized it.  There are many ways I could see TLX advertised, mostly as ""all-included"" luxury with a sporty slant.  The last message they want to convey is ""me to"" (as there is enough of existing perception of that), but this stupid German tune does exactly that."
1967,At least it is a really nice car. I was quite smitten with the one I played around in last week while at the dealer.
1968,"I attended BMW's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership.  I like those, as you get a car without a salesman.  I drove 428i Gran Coupe and souped up 335ix with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all M-Sport related.  335 was fast, but I already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power.  The new LCI steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel."
1969,"Well I think the idea is to create an atmosphere that the TLX is just as good as your German sedan hence the tagline ""How do you say your lease is up in German?"""
1970,Flight- What's your next Bimmer- a 340?
1971,"The Q50 lost to the TLX in a few reviews, not by much, however.  After a few months, I really like the lower NVH from the last gen G.  (They have dealer-installed kit to enhance the exhaust note that a review thought was very effective.)"
1972,"It's after 11PM, I'm feeling a bit peckish -- and for some reason I feel the need to post the following:"
1973,"I would not buy Toyota vehicle, although I noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably.  In its own right, Toyotas are  actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are.  If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours.  To hate Toyota  the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far.  Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance.  Toyota absolutely excels in those.  Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else.  Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom.  You may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact."
1974,"dino001, excellent points.  Lot of folks out there don't consider driving to be joyful but a chore in need of a tool.  A cheap but dependable tool."
1975,Counterpoint..
1976,Agree KYFDX- had a 1994 Camry that my wife (at the time girlfriend) acquired as a gift-it lasted us for quiet some years with zero issues.
1977,"Nobody ""needs""  ELLPS. By definition, it's a product category around satisfaction of a desire, not a necessity."
1978,"BTW, that Hilux episode of Top Gear was amazing.  They beat the snit of it, subjecting it to all kinds of abuses.  starting ""gently"" by numerous fender benders, escalating to more and more serious peril.  They submerged it in the Ocean by leaving the truck on a beach with highest tides in the world and the thing started afterwards.  They tried to kill it multiple times and it would not die."
1979,"I currently drive a 2013 Volvo S60 T5, but have owned a Camry and 2 Avalons, the last one a 2005.  The Toyotas did what I expected of them - Provide good, reliable transportation.  The 2005 Avalon was a great highway cruiser.  Very solid and comfortable.  Fun to drive - Not so much.  I get that from the Volvo.  I guess it all depends on what you're looking for when you make the purchase.  At the time I bought the Toyotas, fun to drive was not high on my list of priorities, as I was building a career and raising a family.  I now have the option of indulging my fun to drive craving.  I still have a lot of appreciation for what Toyota offers to car buyers."
1980,"Rick is getting a 2016 328i GT, the pricing guide and ordering guide was JUST released.. We are looking for a Aug ED."
1981,Auto review..
1982,"I dunno....the last few Camrys I've been in, I've been underwhelmed with the fit an finish.  Granted, these were rentals.  But still, Camrys used to be known for their fit, finish, build robustness, as well as their efficiency.  The last couple I've been in....squeaks, rattles, cheap feeling controls, etc.  Very ""un""-Toyota like."
1983,OR the speeding tickets....
1984,"I don't know, the 90+ year old neighbor I have that gets a new car every 3 or 4 years has replaced his old Buick's with a Hyundai Azera, Sonata Hybrid, and now a Camry Hybrid, in that order."
1985,"Come to think of it, I can't remember when I was last in a Toyota showroom.....and I shop cars a lot."
1986,We tend to upgrade-Mazda- Acura- BMW- what's my next upgrade? only time will tell.
1987,"I have nothing against Camrys but when a friend of mine said they were ""great cars"",  I felt compelled to correct him saying, ""good cars yes, but hardly great ones"".  I told him there was a reason why the USA was the only major market (including Japan IIRC) where the Camry was at or near the top in sales."
1988,"I think the Camry is also quiet and comfy, or at least should be.  Camry buyers wouldn't mind a Lexus like interior either."
1989,Midsize entry-level lux sales in May:
1990,"I would be bet there are more people who look at cars as an appliance then there are auto enthusiasts and for those who want an appliance, the Camry is a great car.. But Buick as well as Chevy are building some damn nice Appliances too, One of my last cars I rented when I was on the road was a Chrysler 200c, granted the auto mag's gave it luke warm review, it is a step in the right direction."
1991,Poor Cadillac.
1992,ATS still getting hammered for some reason.  Q40 needs an update.
1993,Looks like a previous generation A4- yaaawn.
1994,"I thought I read they intended to coexist with Fiat dealers. And I'm going to take a guess about your next point, which I think is a good one: If you want to be priced at and considered the same as BMW/Mercedes/Lexus, you'd better have your own dealerships."
1995,"Looking at Alfa websites, they already have dealers there.  Those in my area are same as Fiat, which are part of multibrand franchises.  So all it will do is add another nameplate and probably a separate showroom (perhaps not immediately)."
1996,The Fiat dealer close to me (McKinney TX) already has an Alfa sign on the building below the Fiat sign.  Should be above it but maybe they are waiting until some actual Alfa's show up.
1997,There is only one Alfa dealer in MA and it's owned by Herb Chambers that has about 60 total locations.  The address of the Alfa dealership is across the street from the Fiat store.  He has a Maserati store about 30 miles away in a hoity toity suburb.
1998,Wayland is a ht town? Go east young man.
1999,"You don't think Wayland is hoity toity?  Yes, it's the poorest of the three W's - Weston, Wellesley, Wayland but it's still top 10 in state income."
2000,"The ordering guide and prices for the LCI (life Cycle Impluse aka a refresh) has been publish SOP (start of Production) is 06-2015.. Some interesting things..  On all 3 series Sport Suspension is now standard, LED lights are now standard. But have a look for yourself."
2001,"Sport suspension IS NOT standard, read again.  328/335 has standard current Sport Line aesthetic elements and seats.  You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package.  However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering.  If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form."
2002,"BMW has to upgrade their interiors, especially the dash, IMHO, as Mercedes interiors are now light-years ahead."
2003,"Agreed.  Not only Mercedes - Audi, Acura, Lexus.  Pretty much everybody is ahead.  However, to be fair, upgrade different inlays make big differences on the interiors.  However, the instrument cluster is still a  1980s."
2004,"dino001 - I would disagree with ONE of your ""is ahead"" selections, and that would be the Acura. The Acura interior, while probably able to be applauded for its tech still seems to show its Honda-ness too much.  In fact, the Acura and Infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from Audi and Mercedes.  The slow-but-steady improvements in BMW's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two Germans I noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors."
2005,"I think the 2011 or 2012 and older Mercedes C-Class had a more Honda-like interior than Acura.  Granted, it improved in either 2012 or 2013, but before that, yuck!"
2006,The Louisville Fiat dealer has an Alfa sign up as well.
2007,Dino you are wrong....
2008,Here is the ordering guide to show you Dino (and I highlighted) that the sport suspension is standard.
2009,"There are three types of suspensions: standard, M-sport (704) available on ""i"" models with both ZMP and and ZTR and adaptive M-sport (2VF) available on ""i"" and ""x"" models with same packages.  S-line is standard, indeed, but it was changed to not include 704, just like it didn't on ""x"" models.  I stand by my statement.  The standard suspension will be retuned to be more sporty, but that's not sport suspension."
2010,"man, BMW has gone off the rails with this stuff.  between having about 20 different models, and these endless (and convoluted) option configurations, it could take a math PhD with a cray all day to figure out what to order!"
2011,No word yet on whether the LCI F3x 3ers will need a new battery at every Oil Service...
2012,"Just curious, what with the discussion about BMW's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: How many folks  [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting?  In my experience, the only person -- besides me -- I know who ""always"" orders her German cars is my wife."
2013,"I sometimes ordered my new BMWs(and once needed my salesperson to go to the mat with Munich when BMW wanted an ""optional"" sunroof to become mandatory), but the crux oof my complaint is that BMW still bundles some options. It's fine to offer packages that combine popular options at a perceived ""savings,"" but I wish that BMW would take a page out of Mini's playbook and make every option available individually. I suppose it's a moot point for me; after 32 years of continuous ownership(not to mention years of service in BMW CCA at both the chapter and national level) I've almost totally lost interest in the marque- I recently sold one of my BMWs and will likely cull at least one more from the fleet."
2014,"Funny thing...I've heard people complain when they don't have enouhg options to craft a new car with the exact options they want, and others who complain about having too many options.  Can't win if you're the manufcturer, it seems."
2015,"No doubt, Herb has great business.  I bought two Hondas from him and felt the pricing was fair.  As the biggest dealer in the Boston area, it's natural for him to be the biggest advertiser.  At least he's not pretending to be working in the service department like Ernie Boch.  I've looked at some used cars from Herb with smart pricing and checked over at Real World Trade In Values and the numbers are pretty much on target.  The service at Honda is reasonable for basic things."
2016,"No that is only on the 550i... I sort of laugh at the guys who beat their chest about owning one, then come to find out that the N63 engine has major problems, that can run up to 10K to fix (but BMW has stepped up and covered the cost with a retro fix.) Now the dealer has been replacing the battery in them too at each service.. This is why I believe the 535d is the best choice in the 5 series line up.."
2017,"I'm all for packaging options, as long as it makes sense. I really don't want to deal with all individual options, especially on the used car market."
2018,"I ordered my E46, didn't on my 320i, we are ordering Ricks GT, as well as my next BMW. BMW last year 2014, did 22K  European Delivery's at the Welt last year (this includes people from around the world, not just in the US.) that number is up from the previous year. BMW BMW does more European Delivery then MB and Audi. Of course BMW dealers really don't push this, as they too want instead sales, as well as the SA... But it appears more and more people are doing it."
2019,"I have been told that Porsche really is flexible when it comes to ordering from them, just because the website does not allow it doesn't mean you can't get it your way. The same with BMW, just have to ask."
2020,"It's all relative.  In their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. American price sheet for the 3-series is three or four pages, the one in Europe is a 30 page booklet. So, in fact, American ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. It's of course reflected in the pricing.  I also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers.  This of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainstream"" are still at mercy of Joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the list."
2021,"Moreno openec up the most st recent Mercedes dealer in the Cincinnati area (actually, it's in Northern KY, just across the bridge from Cincinnati, over the Ohio River)."
2022,"Being one of those sportbikers, spent many a sunday going up and down Palomar, there are two side, S7 (East side) which is the longer of the two roads and S6 which is the tight side (also called the south side) S6 dumps onto Hiway 76."
2023,"I really REALLY liked the Extreme Contact DW's, which were fine until I tracked them.  Then they chunked even with the lightweight A3.  Absent track days, they should be killer.  Do you really need the S in DWS if only for a few days?  I think you should just drive extra EXTRA carefully on those rare snow days, and enjoy the other 360 days a year a notch better!!!"
2024,"I have had extremely good luck with the Cooper Zeon RS3-A as the year-round tire on the X3 and as the ""winter"" tire on my MS3. That said, I haven't heard anything negative about the Contis. I'd also give the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 a good hard look."
2025,Isn't your car leased?  How many miles do you have on it?  How many months/miles do you have left?
2026,"The issue is not so much the snow (coefficient of friction) but the things that happen to a ""summer performance"" tire when temps drop below 45F.  So, while I could probably use and enjoy a summer tire in the summer (I had them on my 2009 A4), well, in the winter, the ride and handling characteristics of the car reminded me of ""driving on the rims.""  The car exhibited what I call ""same day"" turning, and the ride and the sounds from the road were, for lack of a better term, ""brittle."""
2027,rare poster; frequent lurker...
2028,"Normally on a lease, you give back the car with the OEM tires- unless you driving habits are over the top.:)"
2029,Flight- I have a 320 XI Sport for a loaner- 535 in for the foot-rest creaks.
2030,Thanks
2031,"""Normally?"" I'd say that the OEM tires may be good for anywhere between 12,000 and 36,000 miles.  In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear.  If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces."
2032,"I agree.  I have 45k in my 328i sport pack and the second rears are coming to a replacement in couple of months, mabe four.  5 thousand miles tops.  Fronts  are wearing a bit longer, but I replaced them togeteher last time at 25k, this time it looks they will probably last a bit longer."
2033,Promising:
2034,"Many people like myself who owned the original ZPH 330i find this new one an insult. It's a parts bin special, The original ZPH was not, Nothing different about the transmissions, nothing special about the interior, nothing different about the engine, so the new ZPH has the MPPK, MPE anyone can buy them and if done right at a lower price then this package. I can't wait to see how much the price is going to be for this ""ZPH"" car..."
2035,"I don't mean to rub any salt in the wounds, but I think it's fair to ask that you share your updated ""review and aversions"" for Cadillac with the people that frequent this forum topic, as they might not be familiar with the other you've posted in."
2036,"FYI, GG also had a very unpleasant experience with the Audi dealer network."
2037,"Yes, but he's been BURNED BEFORE by Cadillac, this is simply history repeating itself."

2049,"I lived in Manhattan for 8 years (Upper East Side) and parked a car on the street the entire time, doing the Alternate Side Tango the whole time.  In retrospect it seems like insanity but then I am CRAZY about cars and I did get good use out of it.  Like most Manhattanites I went out of town most summer weekends."
2050,"I suppose it's cheaper to rent if you are only doing it a few weekends a year.  You'd have to buy all the extra overpriced insurances, since you have none since you don't have a vehicle."
2051,Anyone in Manhattan living out of their van and parking space? Do they ban camper/trailers?
2052,"If one rents a couple of weekends a year, it's not that expensive.  Or one joins ZipCar.  It's $35 a year for a membership and about $30 a night on top of the regular rate to keep a car overnight.  That includes insurance."

2057,"Good, as I have neither..."
2058,Touche.....
2059,"I once saw the rainbow unicorn of cars.  A recent model Toyota Corolla ""S"" model being driven like it was an autocross modified Miata on a time trial run, but on a public back road that has plenty of curves.  This guy kept up a very healthy fast pace in front of me for a good 7 miles or so,"
2060,It already was. They call it the ES350 and sell it at Lexus.
2061,"Bzzzz ... sorry, the ES doesn't qualify as there is no ""P"" in it. ""ELLS"", sure."
2062,"Plus, I heard it's not a Camry anymore, it's Avalon."
2063,"OK, a Camry that's been through the Medieval Rack treatment ..."
2064,I think Toyota has plans to install the V8 from the IS-F model into the Camry or ES and will call it the Camry Hellcat.
2065,"Go on, pull the other one."
2066,Nothing Japan (let alone Korea) ever produces will be worthy.
2067,"Oh, come on now. Back when it was new, the G35 was a competitor. They could do it again. Not sure it will qualify for this category, but that upcoming Infiniti sedan with the GTR running gear could be interesting."
2068,"Sorry to sidetrack the conversations. To me camry is just a reliable transportation that could have been any of the sort. Not about individual net worth either, as there are people much wealthier and driving lesser cars. Just that I think they are probably not interested in cars to begin with."
2069,"To some people a car is an appliance, plain and simple. Get's them from point A to point B, they know that they will have to replace said appliance every 7-10 yrs with another appliance these people are happy with what they drive. However, some people in their forum can't wrap their head around this concept, just like on bimmerfest, some guy was very insulting to people who have a 528i and 535i, because in his small mind the only 5 series worth having is the 550i."
2070,So here is a video of the new XE with audio of the engine...
2071,If only the XE was available New Year's Eve 2013!
2072,WOW... did everybody fall off the face of the earth?
2073,Enjoying my F10- getting familiar with the many functions of the I-Drive.
2074,Here is my recommendation to everyone here.
2075,"Highland Valley Rd is a great road, also going out to Bates Nut Farm is a good one too. But the real run is going up Mt. Palomar on the south side (we called it the tight side)"
2076,"Any highway you can find that is designated as a State Route (ie. SR-# or S-#) is fairly easy for thrill seekers to find.  Roads..... now that's much harder to find.    Mt. Palomar falls into the S-route category, but it is a great one.  The tight side is more like the ""west"" side though.   Either way, you'll encounter many sport bikes enjoying that road, and unfortunately if you are driving spiritedly, you'll inevitably come up behind a Toyota or other absurdly slow vehicle climbing the very twisty switchback grades."
2077,"Can we add the new Volvo S60R T6 that has similar (but falls short) numbers to the S4 to the list.  Was at about 45K dollar wise, but I didn't get to drive it as it was indoors."
2078,News: Audi B9 coming -- but not exactly soon . . .
2079,"I saw the BMW announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models.  I always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with.  That said, I had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to BMW, upped the HP and torque ratings by about 20 each.  So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine.."
2080,"Totally agree.  I think their general interiors are not so bad, especially when you go for some of the optional items, such as wood finish with real leather, but their dashboard and instrument cluster feels 30 years old."
2081,How do you guys compare Infiniti Q40 and Subaru Legacy Limited 2.5 with eyesight ? They are both almost cost the same to me. I know that Subaru is not Luxury car but The Legacy comes with all new technologies that other Luxury brands cannot offer in this price range. But Q40 is almost 5 years old technology with crash prevention technology at all. The interior of both are Leather. Of course Q40 is 3.7 and more performance and fuel hungry....
2082,When was Cable TV added to the luxury list?
2083,"Having driven a Q40 in it's former G37 guise and owning a 2015 Legacy 2.5i Premium, I can tell you that these are 2 completely different vehicles.  I can offer you a few pieces of advice.  1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership.  Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015).  Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate."
2084,"Not sure what the ""Eyesight"" option is on the Legacy.  Is it some pre-crash alert system?"
2085,Eyesight package include:
2086,Thanks a lot. You mentioned extra horsepower is a plus for Q40/G37... To me that is a secondary since I should have to pay more for gas on Q40. Its MPG is low. Is there any other plus in Q40 compared with Legacy that you can imagine ?
2087,"Wow; if I was a totally moronic and incompetent driver the ""Eyesight Package"" would be a must-have!"
2088,"Remember the old 1980s joke about how Volvos were built for people who hated cars? Well maybe all these Eyesight gadgets are for people who hate driving?  (and sometimes when on the road, I wouldn't blame them btw)."
2089,"The eyesight gadget fans not only hate driving, they also seem to take pride in the fact that their driving skills are abysmal; ""Why adjust my mirrors properly? Why practice situational awareness? Heck, why should I look past the end of my hood? Let the car do all that."""
2090,The Subie's Eyesight seems like a great safety feature.
2091,"GG, the red XKE roadster of my father's friend is what led me to the lair of the Jaguar!  For your next chronic car buying experience, you should check 'em out, not your father's Jag.  Man, the XE is getting some great press so far."
2092,"The above is the spirit and some of the actual words I wrote.  Most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, TV and so on.  More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make  -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever).  The thing is very few of us can ""have it all.""  And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all.  My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car.  He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car.  He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for.  He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am.  This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old."
2093,The best collision avoidance system (or Eyesight) is a good attentive driver.
2094,"On paper, agreed.  Problem is we all get tired or a level of distraction.  Some help countering this could be helpful."
2095,"You say that now, but when you are running late and need to check messages, oh, yeah people on this forum don't do that..."
2096,"In regards to the standard sport package on the 328's, there is talk that the sport seats might now be standard. Of course some people over on BF are splitting hairs on what the press release says. Not everybody wants those sport seats, so to force people to have them, would drive people away from BMW... One thing I'm waiting to see is how much is this new Premium package going to be, since it now comes with LED lights. LED lights on other BMW's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a 328i is $3100. So $5K is very steep, and some people could careless about the LED's for $1900,,,  I would have liked to see Xemon being standard on all BMW's, even the El Cheapo 320i.  But until the ordering guide is released (hopefully next week) we wont know for sure of prices."
2097,"The 340i gets the new ""B"" series engine, so hopefully there will be a MPPK for this engine and Exhaust which would give the car roughly 370hp."
2098,"My understanding of the release is that everything but suspension from Sport Line will be standard on 328 - and I love it.  I also have a concern about premium package pricing (and 340 as well, since premium pack features will be standard there).  LED prices went down, but I'm sure BMW would like to keep the margins, if only let by the market.  Seems like they're going away from HID lights altogether, for obvious reasons - green commies from Europe and America hate those, as they'd rather you poison yourself with mercury from CFL than use couple of kWh more; CFL doesn't work for headlights, so LEDs are next ""best"" thing)."
2099,"I wonder how their muffler looks like.  If they drove 8 blocks to work in the middle of winter, there is probably only rusty shell left - you touch it, it's gone into dust."
2100,"Basically power, performance, & handling are the Q40's major advantages.  It's all what you put stock in.  I happen to like all that stuff, but didn't exactly have the budget when the lease was up on my 2011 BMW 328xi.  I also do a lot more driving than average (over 20K per year), so leasing gets pricey."
2101,Don't people in NY ever go on road trips????  Rent a car I suppose?
2102,Not everyone goes on road trips.
2103,never said they drove it 8 blks
2104,You never watched Seinfeld.
2105,"The cost of a parking space in Manhattan per square foot is about the same as the cost of an apartment per sq. ft.  It's not uncommon for parking spaces attached to condos or co-ops, to sell for $225,000, because only 1% of this type of building has parking.  Some people buy parking spaces as real estate investments in Manhattan."
2106,common in the city is renting a car for the weekend when they need to go out of town.  Much cheaper than owning and storing one.
2107,"Neither would I, but I'd like to see percentage of those sold into fleets vs. retail. Also, the fact that ATS is even less, if baffling.  Must be a real dog at the moment - and the car isn't so bad.  I think the right people haven't found them yet. Looks people likely to like ATS don't even bother to come and look at it."
2108,Any numbers for the Q40? I think they should be added to the Q50 numbers.....
2109,Yes the ATS is a great car that is being ignored. It doesn't broadcast the proper image for the wearers and the enthusiasts unjustly write the car off- associating it with the AARP Specials the marque used to crank out.
2110,Looks like a new addition is coming to the ELLPS family:
2111,"Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc)  is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6.  This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon."
2112,"I'm the one that wrote about VW's long product cycle.  I have a B5 Passat.  It was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year.  In today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long."
2113,+1. Not everyone worships at the altar of German cars.  Some of us would rather drive Honda's and retire early than drive fancy-schmancy cars.  To each their own.
2114,"It's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe.  It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less.  No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash.  The incentive may or may not be extended.  This alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."
2115,I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.
2116,"Millions buy a Honda or Toyota because it is all they can afford, they are not ""settling"". It's hard for some to understand that it seems.  Some even aspire to same."
2117,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area.  As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago."
2118,"I'm not slamming Hondas-I'm going to give the upcoming 300 hp Civic Type R a good hard look-but if you pick the right car and service facility you can run a ""fancy-schmancy"" German car for little more than it costs to run a Honda- witness my 318ti and my son's X3. That said, a Japanese car is my current favorite for strafing back roads-but then it's a bit of a hooligan sled."
2119,"Jag, huh?  Whoda thunk it?"
2120,Interesting choice of engines too.  a 2.0L Turbo Diesel 4 cyl & a 3.0 Super Charged Gasser V6.  Talk about spicing up the segment:)
2121,Pace without diesel clatter grace!
2122,Laurasdada
2123,"A 2L turbo gas will come 6 months later, btw its the Ford Ecoboost 2L."
2124,"We all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing.  And, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the Honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an Acura.  They settle for the Honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ELLPS or LPS.   Things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds."
2125,"You just don't get it.  I know we all ""settle"" or make compromises, but many people actually buy used cars until they can afford that shiny new Honda which they have wanted for years. And no, they can't afford an Acura.   Saying they can afford an Acura or maybe an Audi but have settled for a Honda makes assumptions that reflect a real disconnect.  Isn't it possible that some have ""settled"" in other areas just so they could buy their new Honda?"
2126,Mark.....all good points.
2127,"Plenty of people ""settle"" for Accords and Camrys, because they don't see the value in the luxury makes, not because they can't afford it..   It's just not important to them."
2128,Yep....!
2129,"It's the wife's, base.  She chose it over the E-Class because she found it to be ""sportier."""
2130,"My son, somewhat quoting Clarkson, is disappointed that I ""settled"" for a Jag as I couldn't afford an Aston Martin.  Although, at 16 and soon to be licensed, he feels I should give the Jag to him."
2131,"You find that in many major cities.  People don't own a car because they don't have to.  Everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door.  In NYC, you might consider having one if one lived in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island.  The further away from Manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car."
2132,"It's not just that.  It seems they are repackaging things.  It still depends on the prices, but I actually like some of the moves - 340 (more hp, so they can bump up the number) gets premium package standard, which is how it should be - I just hope the price differential between 328 and 340 won't get prohibitive.  They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board.  There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it.  I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option."
2133,"""It's the wife's, base. She chose it over the E-Class because she found it to be ""sportier."""
2134,"I actually test drove the 2.0T ATS and the 3.6 ATS and both didn't have enough grunt to steer me clear of the S4.  There were other things too, but that was one of the main problems.  Obviously, I'm sure the ATS-V would solve that, and while the real world selling price might be competitive, last I checked the stickers were ridiculous (I last checked in 2013)."
2135,"I bet you many of those millions have a 800 dollar smart phone financed over a 2 year contract.  Cable TV, and other luxuries they felt was more important than ""affording"" something more than a Honda or Toyota."
2136,"The sales of the current Passt is higher then the last Gen, the previous Gen passt was too expensive, just like the Jetta. I too liked the previous Gen Passt, felt more like an Audi then a VW. I think this is why VW has a hard time selling the CC, it's expensive.."
2137,"I was aware of that.  Current situation is a result of years of ""streamlining"".  I probably should have chosen Toyota as my example, as those guys have much more elaborate option structure, yet the ordering mindset is just like Honda's, not BMW's."
2138,"It's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop.  Because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it.  The consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly.  Of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"".  The gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."
2139,"Honda and Acura are at least honest about it:  some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. I can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there.  The problem is, others (Toyota, Ford, Mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable).  BMW and Benz will usually gladly take an order.  It seems VW dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as Roadburner said, ""cold fusion"" difficult."
2140,Well they seem to be having a hard time selling what they have out now. Their sales are down and way below targets.
2141,"VW's problem was they alienated their old customers, but initially gained some ground on their cheaper and dumbed down models, but ran out of steam.  My guess is people figured out that if you want a Corolla clone, better get the original.  To me VW is a cautionary tale to BMW.  You may have an early success, such as a new Jetta and Passat had, but this doesn't guarantee long run."
2142,"VW has never really understood the US market since the days of the original Rabbit. The one constant has been their ""Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks."" marketing strategy"
2143,"As a VW owner and an active member of a VW forum, I feel that I can speak to some of their issues."
2144,"In ither words, they are too slow.  BTW, great description, LOL."
2145,"Excellent summation,"
2146,"The strong dollar does make exporting the Polo cheaper but would it be cheap enough?  What happens when the dollar weakens and then VW is losing money on every Polo imported from Spain?  Perhaps if the next Polo (MK VII) moves onto the MQB platform, then it can be made in the US or Mexico and be profitable."
2147,"Honda has been well known for that since the 1980's.  Honda is well committed to the minimal trim lines within a model and then options are dealer installed model.  It seems to work for them just fine and in reality, I find that most people would rather have that than a dizzying array of options to choose from.  Further, it makes driving it home today much easier."
2148,You can't make multiyear decisions based on six months of data.  It has to work also when dollar is at levels from year ago.
2149,So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?
2150,"That could be an option, but considering all costs, generally low volume and pricing centraints of US market, small cars are tough.  It's not an easy decision to bring such a vehicle to here."
2151,"IT works for them because the buying public allows it to happen. What would happen if Honda's sales would drop say, 13% a year and market research shows that people want to be able to order their cars? Would Honda change?"
2152,"you still can't get anything you want with a domestic.  Maybe some more packages or stand alone options.  But Honda has been this way for a long time, so not likely to change.  Very efficient.  And frankly, now that sticks are pretty much out of the mix, about the only issue is regarding the moonroof (mostly wanting leather, etc. without one).  Other than that, you can get pretty much what you want."
2153,So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?
2154,"If that were to actually happen, which we all now is highly doubtful, Honda might change - or they might not."
2155,"How about color choice? As I posted if you want a top level Accord, hope black is your favorite color as that is the only color. Anything from EX-L up is limited in color too.. Not too sure what you mean by, "" you can get pretty much what you want.""  In the domestic market you can order separate items, but the trick is finding a dealer that is willing to do it. Ricks father only buys buicks, he just bought a Enclave which he ordered and was able to get stand-a-lone items that where part of a package... So it can happen.."
2156,"I would have no problem paying a somewhat premium for a Teutonic (and it doesn't even have to be made in Germany) driving vehicle with a really nice interior - you know, like the early 2000's Jetta and Passat. What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network. That IMHO is why VW has missed the boat. And also agree that they are slow to respond."
2157,"The 2014 S4 Order form I used to customize my order for the 2014 S4 didn't have a ""delete Moon-roof"" option written on it.   I suppose I should have thought of ""writing in"" my specifications, but with no credit, I'd of probably hesitated to delete it.  If they'd even give me $50 back I'd do it."
2158,"Agreed 100%.  How can I choose a color if I haven't seen it in person; paper and monitors often don't come close to replicating actual colors.  How can I decide if that 1,100 dollar adaptive S4 suspension is worth the money if there are none to test drive anywhere you go?  Also was impossible to find the specs on how much weight, if any, the adaptive suspension adds (I assume it adds some)."
2159,"I don't think those SM's are dumb.  They just have an ""average"" mind for their average customer.  At least Audi or BMW lets you order easily, which is a workaround.  I can live with that and I'm even willing to pay, as long as the premium is reasonable. Other brands often take act of Congress."
2160,some entry level lux sales numbers for April:
2161,Lincoln sells more MKZs than Audi does A4s?
2162,"Big differences, Rob.  I guess Tampa buyers ain't big on leather, or so think the sales managers."
2163,"I did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure."
2164,"I think that claim of your friend's is based on observation that many of his purchases are based on customer walking in and buying without testing.  What he doesn't see, or account for, are customers testing first in any location, then going home, sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer, which may not be the place they actually test drove."
2165,"dino -- good point, I would, however, say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks don't test drive as much as they used to (or as much as my wife and I do NOW.)  I'd say my wife and I are really oddballs, in that we test-drive new cars as serious hobby-ists.  I like to think, however, we don't test drive cars we're pretty sure we'd NEVER buy. Of course there was that one test drive of a new Lincoln crossover, what were we thinking?  The thing had a horrible suspension -- reminded me of driving a full-size van (where we live, down by the river.)"
2166,"I know my next F10 or should I say G30 will be ordered- well lets hope BMW does not carry over the current 3 series front end to the G30. PLEASE BMW, DONT."
2167,"Yeah, I'd like to test drive more than I do.  But I'm too considerate of the dealer's business.  I have a friend with no such limits.  He goes and pretends to be interested in a new S-class just so he can ""experience"" it.  Too me it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care.  He always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed christian faith (like ""I may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion).  Well, he does those things with (justifications) with other things, too - so I'm used to that hypocrisy by now."
2168,"I really don't see any ""hypocrisy"" in any of this.  I have test driven many cars that I did not expect to buy.  And at least twice during my life I have purchased something that I never thought I would purchase, based primarily on that test drive."
2169,"You don't know my friend.  He would never do that.  He purely and clearly (by his own admission) ""test-drove"" those cars for entertainment purpose only.  ""The story"" was for the external consumption.  BTW, this is just part of his behavioral pattern, so the hypocrisy thing is just endemic to him in many other aspects of his life.  Not that I'm free of it myself, I just admit it when it's clear (he doesn't)."
2170,"My wife and I certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving.  But there is actually a legitimate purpose too.  Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy.  For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money).  I just don't bother test driving them, therefore."
2171,Edmunds has a 2015 TLX V6 SH-AWD in their long term fleet.  Here is a god write up on how it performs and how it compares to it's 4cyl brother:
2172,I would save a lot of $ and get an ILX instead
2173,"Over a TLX 4cyl, right?"
2174,"Over either one, but definitely over the 4 cyl TlX"
2175,"Our home was bought new, and the builder allowed some changes to be made to the interior of the house, Rick is seeing more and more builders allowing these changes to be made. So we did get the house we wanted, without playing the construction loan convert to conventional loan game.. We have a friend who did this in Carmel Calif, a very nice, very upscale seaside town in northern calif. After the house was completed at a cost of 6 million dollars the appraiser did not appraise the house at that price, so no loan.. Now, the house sits on a bluff over looking the pacific ocean, the dinner room, kitchen and family room each have 90 to 120 degree view of the ocean, it's simply breathtaking. So he is paying on a construction loan for now and working with 3 banks to convert this loan... Building a house is not the same as building and waiting 4-6 week for your car to come in."
2176,"4CG is selling much better then what BMW was expecting, it's a rarity because BMW can't produce then fast enough."
2177,"It's the same instant gratification.  The salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today.  The order is in the future.  It can be canceled.  The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops.  The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it.  The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions.  They essentially already decided for us what we want."
2178,Back in 2007 I was planning on buying a new GTI for my next HPDE instructor car; the local VW dealers acted like ordering a car was more difficult than achieving cold fusion so I walked and ended up with my MS3. A true blessing in disguise as I've since heard that the local VW dealers have a firm policy of refusing to hire service technicians with opposable thumbs...
2179,"LOL, Roadburner.  I think VW had one of the most inconsistent dealer networks out there.  From absolutely horrible to first class and all in between.  My observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation.  If it belongs to a same place where premium German cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant.  Cross-pollination with fellow BMW or Audi usually helps.  However, if it belongs to one of those Hyundai-Kia-Toyota-VW-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason.  Attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well.  However, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a Kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a VW store, he is not going to change his habits."
2180,"Dino, Pemske has a large auto dealership network and in Scottsdale they have a very large dealership that ranges from Porsche, BMW, Jaguar, Range Rover, and VW, the three times I was in that VW dealer (on the same lot as the Range Rover) the treatment was first class. Just too bad that VW has dummy down their line up, to be competitive with the likes of Ford and Chevy."
2181,"yeah, on a Honda it is just a matter of doing a search for the specific model and color combo.  Which is almost always out there someplace."
2182,"You know, in the early 2000's VW had really made their interiors nice - a Passat I rode in had light yellow leather and seemed to me on an interior level the equal of a BMW interior. It was really luxurious. VW had product that both drove well and was very nice inside. Almost an EELPS!"
2183,"Taking delivery the same day is more of a dealer-driven phenomemon than a consumer need for instant gratification.   It's the whole ""bird in hand"" thing.."
2184,"I agree 100%. And the suits at VW should know better- especially after the drubbing they received in the early '80s when US built Rabbits were softened and ""Americanized."""
2185,Sometimes automakers DO remember the past and just make the same mistake twice
2186,"I look at the Japaneses car companies at making appliances, you can't option out a washer, just move up to higher model. That is what the Japanese do, want leather in an Accord, then move up to the EX-L, if you are looking at the LX but want sunroof, you need to move up the higher model that might come with equipment you don't want. Lexus and Infiniti does this too."
2187,You haven't been to the Honda Website in a while... BTW there are more then a few theoretical configurations you can't get at honda.. Some are classic color combo's.
2188,Yes; the 335d gets the 8HP45- go figure; I remember a BMW engineer saying that the reason that the 335d was only available with an automatic was because they didn't have a manual box that could withstand the torque...
2189,I agree with your review of the S3.
2190,"I've long stated and believed that the only mag that doesn't sound like cheerleader marketing was Consumer Reports.  It would be hard to pinpoint obvious direct blatant biases with proof, but you get the general impression of bias from advertisers in magazines that derive income from advertisers."
2191,"I've long said that the Sport Rear Diff should be standard on all Quattro Audi's, especially S models like the S4.  Whoever decided that making moon roofs standard was more important for about the same price as the Rear Diff option should be shot.  How can anyone choose navigation or sun roof over the torque vectoring?  I'm dumbfounded."
2192,flight:
2193,"Mark, many people on this forum have said this, regarding the Germans they will nickel and dime you on features that should standard, Bluetooth audio should be standard, it's not... Backup camera, Alarm systems.."
2194,"There are plenty if buyers that would never know they have one, or drive in a way it would make a difference. Heck, plenty probably can't tell ( or really care) what wheels are driving it.  Catering to the small % of buyers that really appreciate performance is why the S models exist."
2195,"BMW has always been one of the worst brands with respect to options and how they are ""packaged.' I do have to give Munich kudos for offering the sunroof delete option on the M235i..."
2196,If you delete the sunroof do you get a CREDIT?
2197,"I'd prefer a credit, even without one I'm just happy not being forced to take a hole in the roof."
2198,"No credit if you don't want the sunroof,"
2199,"I, for one, would still do it.  Delete the sunroof, that is, even if the price did not decline."
2200,"On an E36 the sunroof cassette adds 65 pounds to the highest point of the car. As TC Kline told me, ""It's equivalent to strapping your car's battery to the roof..."""
2201,"According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles.  The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable."""
2202,"Mark - interesting points you make. As a moderator here at Edmunds, I help folks with lease numbers (MF and residual). Often the question comes up about picking a car that is a good deal - I often reply with something along the lines of ""when you're looking at a $30K / $40K / $50K / $60K car, why wouldn't you get exactly what you want rather than what the dealer has on the lot?"""
2203,"Most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too.  Like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small."
2204,"Bingo.  There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything.  That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved.  Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want.  One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"".  I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months.  ""Why would you wait?"", they asked."
2205,The vast majority of Americans want their new cars TODAY!!  Waiting 6-12 weeks isn't the norm.
2206,"Also without ordering, many people still pick what they want. Just rpthrough dealer swaps or incoming allocations. So you can wait a few days at most and get pretty much anything."
2207,"We do it because we can.  Simple as history.  If there were megalots of cars sitting on every corner in Euro cities they would be doing the same thing.   They order because they have to.  In Europe the car dealers probably took over the space where carriages were custom ordered.  In the U.S., the car dealers just built facilities on the next 10 acre vacant lot in the suburbs.  It's just a different way of doing things and for every anal car addict that posts  here(and I don't mean that derogatorily) there are thousands of people who look at cars as transportation.....even those cars costing $70k.  They just consider them just more luxurious transportation.   I'm pretty sure cars a less expensive in the U.S. and people turn them over a lot quicker than they do in Europe on average.  If I knew I was going to keep a new car 10-12 years and it cost me a lot more I may be a tad bit more picky too."
2208,"Depends.  It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited.  Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations).  Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null.  I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching,  dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels.  No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO.  There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many.  Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply.  Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration.  It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships.  I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand.  I disagree, but who am I?"
2209,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees."
2210,"It's not about Europe being ""Oh so special"".  It's just a statement of fact that in the US we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on 3-series sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two.  It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic.  In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week  - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course"
2211,"Dino, isn't the 4 GC by definition a rarity, so easily within the 5% margin?  You are likely pretty unique in terms of what you want, so certainly should order.  But that doesn't mean the majority of buyers aren't getting what they want by settling."
2212,"One, new home construction hasn't been over a million per year in years.  It may be that someone actually pays more for cars than housing over a 30 year period but IMO it would be exceedingly rare.  I pay more in real estate taxes alone than I pay for my present 3 vehicles per year.  Equating a home purchase with a car purchase is apples to oranges at best.  Americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way, way down the list."
2213,"Agreed on that one.  Yes, it would suck, if the car died.  However, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but I once almost did just that).  I also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related.  An accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable."
2214,Depends as you said.  Local MB dealership has:
2215,"That is exactly my experience, too.  I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life.  Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series.  Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines.  NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever.  ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings?  The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act."
2216,So. . . I guess we should all just take the gas pipe.
2217,When you're bored . . .
2218,"Next up, two more test drives, one in a $56,000 A5 2.0T quattro Cabriolet and one in a $67,000 S5 Cabriolet."
2219,"Here in Phoenix I drove my Miatas with the top down ~40% of the time.  I had a toneau cover and used the heater when necessary to good advantage.  Of course, the issue here is the heat, and the Miatas had decent A/C."
2220,One thing I don't like about convertibles in metro areas is that you and the car's interior get dirty from junk in the air.
2221,"LOL, there are always hazards of driving convertibles..."
2222,"So this past week, the windshield cracked on the BMW, When I got home called the dealer to see what they charge, was quoted $635 for the Windshield, and seal, then labor at $172/hr x 3 hours ($516) for a total of $1,151.. Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor.. So I contacted Safelite, my quote complete with a BMW windshield was $634, this they came to the house and replaced it. It was interesting to hear this guy talk, he and another guy only do high end cars and they are the ones who go the dealership and do them.. So the dealer was going to make $500 bucks by having someone else do the work..."
2223,Very true.  Few dealerships have the ability to change a windshield.  They just sub it out and mark up the price.
2224,"I just caught a rock a couple of weeks ago...    My BMW dealer actually does windshields, which I didn't know until I called them for a recommendation."
2225,"Rick had his windshield replaced on his Geneses twice, the first one was so distorted that I was surprised that the installer from safelite even installed, that was replaced the same day, his second one was OEM  and didn't have a problem. So I'm not too sure if that makes a difference or not but I wanted OEM glass installed."
2226,"My dealer's service department is one of the primary reason's that I've stayed with BMW as long as I have. My Service Advisor never tries to push unnecessary repairs or service and will tell me up front if a less expensive alternative is available. And, since my SA and a couple of the sales guys are HPDE junkies, I have never had a problem with warranty coverage on the cars I track."
2227,I know we've spoken at length here about modifying cars via ECU reflashes and such.  Certain manufacturers are lobbying to make it illegal to modify your car's computer.
2228,"There are ""chip"" providers that do provide a warranty -- far as I know, though, most of their products are NOT approved by the MFG's.  Volvo has partnered with Polestar and cars chipped (from the factory, of course) by Polestar are covered by the OEM warranty.  I don't know if Dinan has any formal relationship with BMW that somehow protects a customer with a Dinan modded BMW from financial ruin.  I don't think StaSIS modded Audis carry an official Audi warranty, but cars so outfitted by StaSIS do have a full warranty and there are actual Audi dealers who retail from the ground up StaSIS outfitted versions."
2229,That's very odd; I believe that Dinan uses piggyback tuners on those cars. I've run Dinan and Conforti chips in pre-OBDII Bimmers with no issues at all.
2230,"Dinan and BMW work closely together, and if you have any Dinan work at an authorized Dinan shop, it is covered under the factory BMW warranty. My 330 had many Dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. My piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues. Now if I had a M5 and was having issues after upgrades, I would take those upgrades off and want my money back... No fun having a car like a M5 sitting in the shop.."
2231,"The other issue I have with Dinan is the price, Dinan just came out with a new line of Electronic tunes for the F cars, starting at a low price of $1500... My tune was $357..  The Dinan tune is to make 237hp for the El Cheapo 320i, the claim doesn't whether it is crank HP or RWP."
2232,Dinan has always been the
2233,"I agree they are pricey but I really think they are crazy expensive these days, I had about $8K of Dinan in my 330, which went pretty far.."
2234,"How is it that a power-plant that outputs, say, 250 pound feet BEFORE chipping and 340 AFTER not putting stress on the transmission originally designed for the original torque output (with some margin built in for durability)? The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM's) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist.  But, over time, won't the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?"
2235,Maybe it's to cover the warranty exposure; who knows?
2236,"This is an excellent question, maybe BMW and Audi have one transmission that is used in all of thier cars, maybe the 8spd in my 320i is the same as used in the 550i, if so then the transmission can handle the extra power and torque.."
2237,Do you really think so??
2238,"The 8 speed ZF(8HPxx) is used in a lot of different brands and depending on the model it can handle anywhere from 332 lb-ft to 665 lb-ft of torque. That said, the F20, F30 and F10 get  the 8HP45, which is not as strong as the 8HP70- which sees duty in the F01, E70, and all the Chrysler/Dodge Hemis save the Hellcats(8HP90)."
2239,So the F10 550i gets the weaker transmission?
2240,My mistake- the 550i gets the 8HP70- as do all the BMW V8s.
2241,Interesting even the 35d's with the 400+ lbs of torque..
2242,"RB....I drove both the 3.6 and the 2.0T in the CTS.  3.6L is a nice motor.  I preferred the 2.0T.  It pulled better in the very lower reaches of the RPM band.  If it had been a 3.6L TT, then different story."
2243,Calling cdnpinhead:
2244,I've been reading the May issue of
2245,"""I assume you mean the M6 Gran Coupe; it is a decent enough cruiser, but I can't saythat I like it all that much better than the B7 press loaner that I took to Motorsport Ranch in 2007"""
2246,Damn!
2247,"It's interesting (I spent my luch break reading my most recent Roundel) that BMW is continuing to direct anyone who wants an ""old school"" BMW toward the M cars."
2248,"""Old school"" cars are gone...."
2249,"Oh please stop the drama... These ""enthusiasts"" don't buy enough cars to keep the company afloat... I guess the M235 isn't good enough..."
2250,"A Physician at work just took delivery of a B6, talk about the right amount of luxury and sport in one car, it also has one of the best mid range torque curve I have driven. But the 150K price tag is big time fat."
2251,"It's true, but they were ones who shouted from rooftops how great their product was, worth paying the money.  So the crowd came, but BMW decided the services of shouting are no longer required.  They may be right, for now.  It's more important if in say ten-twenty years, when nobody shouts and people buy because they got a good deal, BMW goes Acura's way.   It's easy to imagine that.  Acura was also on the rise, until it was not.  They basically have two models of consequence - MDX and TLX, and the latter one is still not close in popularity to old TL.  I don't know, we will see."
2252,"True - even in the 80's, BMW was becoming a status car for poseurs.  They may have been ""driver's cars"" but the vast marketplace wanted the symbol."
2253,"Did you buy your most recent car at least in part because you were drawn to the car's automated safety features (such as adaptive cruise control, parking assist, automatic braking, lane departure warnings, etc.)? If so, a reporter would like to hear your story. Please contact PR@edmunds.com by no later than Monday, April 20, 2015."
2254,"Old School -- not even sure, anymore, what that means exactly.  I wouldn't give up ABS, ESP, Blind Spot Warnings, Parktronic, Rear, Front, Top-view cameras, torque vectoring differentials, brake assist, turbo or super charged ""cleaner"" engines, adjustable suspensions, dual clutch ""automatic manual"" transmissions, fuel stratified injection, voice commands, hand and eyes free phoning capabilities, sat navigation and all the apparently ""New School"" tech noted and most of what I didn't note, too."
2255,"I think that the reason you like your S4 is because the things you liked about your 1995 car are part and parcel of the modern car's driving experience. VW learned the that lesson the hard way; after receiving all sorts of accolades for the Mk I and Mk II GTI, the Mk III and Mk IV were hammered for being soft and uninvolving. VW found the plot again(as the Brits put it) with the Mk V and have not deviated off course with the Mk VI or Mk VII."
2256,"Is this where I get to say ""please stop the drama?"""
2257,Light at the end of the tunnel?
2258,"I broke down and leased a '15 Q50S but it has AWD!  Skipped the steer-by-wire which costs more for weird steering gremlins since it's new tech.  I'm sure this will improve and they'll figure out the ""simulated steering feel"" settings going forward to satisfy everyone.  (Saw one video that shows you can set the car to drive itself for a short period of time when cruising and lane assist engaged.)"
2259,Circle....congrats.  Are we to assume the S model has hydralic steering?
2260,"You can see the trends...BMW getting more ""middle of the road"" as is Infiniti."
2261,I like this quote from 2006:
2262,A German automaker said that? I'm shocked....SHOCKED!
2263,Kind of sums up their attitude in a nutshell......thanks RB!  I've read a couple of different articles that state essentially the same thing about BMW's views.
2264,"Yes, I  chose hydraulic steering."
2265,"Circle, how's the engine sound from the cockpit in your Q?  Is it prominent but toned down from the intrusive sounds in the last generation of G.  I understand it is much more pleasant of an engine (or exhaust) note."
2266,"Please chill -- overall, typically, generally speaking, etc, etc, things are as they are due to the market."
2267,"I think we'll find that as the driving situation on American roads becomes more and more awful, the cars themselves, and their drivers, will continue to adapt to this new environment. The Model T Ford succeeded by paying close attention to the roads it was going to be used on, and I think the modern car is rushing headlong into providing a) safety b) convenience c) comfort, over any ""thrill"" of driving.  Your average driver of a new S5 will never push the car to anywhere close to its capabilities."
2268,"Completely agree.  In fact, MOST drivers, not just the average one's will never even come close to what a lot of cars are actually capable of doing."
2269,"CN, it's the first thing I noticed.  The noise isolation is far better in the Q. It adds that ingredient of sophistication the G lacked but also the engine sounds better as well, particularly during rev-match when shifting in sport mode."
2270,"Ray, I would love to see a photo of this, even the BMW 550i isn't doing 120 at 2500..."
2271,"Graphic, I wish the Auto Mag's would do a comparison of 4 cyl Luxury cars, but then again the E class wouldn't be part of that since the only 4 cyl they have is E250 BluTech. But Audi, BMW and Caddy could go head to head for the battle of who has the best 4 cyl luxury car.."
2272,"I think we need to discuss some of the factors that current buyers look for in an ELLPS, such as:"
2273,"Problem Graphic has a 4 cyl CTS, not a V6..   Also I read that for 2017 the new 5 series will be roughly 250lbs lighter."
2274,Wow...
2275,BWTM:
2276,The way I see it is that the biggest disadvantage of owning the CTS short term is the price.  Of course that is mitigated by a good deal
2277,kyfdx -
2278,To find engine RPM:
2279,"Thanks.. I think ""final drive ratio"" already incorporates the 337 and the tire diameter in there, but I might be wrong.."
2280,"337 * 1.75 * 120 = 70,770"
2281,Okay.. the GR is final drive X gear ratio.. right?   2.65 X 0.67?
2282,2.62 x .667.
2283,"BMW has clearly decided that the enthusiasts who built the brand 40 years ago are no longer of any significant value, relative to those who appreciate numb electric steering and soft suspensions -- never mind RFTs and electric oil level sensors that don't always work."
2284,A stick diesel? Better hope VW offers it in the new golf sport wagon.
2285,"So, before I comment, I need to know why you feel the sport pack makes a difference in such a comparison. I mean, the adjustable magnetic ride control on my CTS is generally regarded as superior in any comparison, so you can't be talking about suspension. I'd give the nod to the BMW sport seats, so maybe that is all you are referring to, although I can't imagine calling 2 cars in different leagues based on just that."
2286,"Brozen-I am not knocking the Caddy, all I am trying to say (and this is just me)  the 5 is just a nicer car to own all around. My tv/audio installer has the CTS and quiet frankly it is a nice car but its just not ""me""."
2287,"I fitted the 2.3 DI turbo in my MS3 with a low restriction MS intake as well as an extremely conservative ECU remap; while the N55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. Which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. In my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and  my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves I can refer to the MS3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face."
2288,"Well, certainly. But I can at least admit they are in the ""same league,"" sport pack or no."
2289,"My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."
2290,"Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers."
2291,The BMW 335iS I had [ 370 TQ from the factory ]
2292,My MS3 now peaks at 324 lb-ft at 4050 rpm. In 6th(top) gear that is only 104 mph.
2293,Burner- If you are happy with your Mazda and all the modifications-all hats off to you.
2294,"billy...no harm, no foul.  I was not enamored with the 5 Series....especially for the price (low $60s).  As far as one being nicer than the other?  Can't really make that connection.  I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5.  You don't see it that way.  No problem for me.  That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points.  Plenty of choice for everyone."
2295,An M6 Grand Coupe M Sport? That's news to me.
2296,"An M235i sedan, with a version of the 370 TQ 3.0 six cylinder"
2297,"You payz your money, you buyz your car.  Personally, while in the same league as the wife's F10 535xi, I much prefer driving my XF.  While not lighter in weight, it feels so behind the wheel.  XF seats better bolstered than the 5s standard chairs, both interiors nice, but the XF a bit more stylized.  Both have their quirks, of course, e.g. hockey puck vs. beer tap shifter.  Much better feel behind the wheel of the XF, 5 too boosted.  Of course, iDrive is a bit better than the Windows Vista infotainment in the Jag!"
2298,"Mark...if I wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, I don't know that the CTS would have made it to my garage."
2299,"So, i actually gave the S3 another test drive.  I usually don't go to any dealerships on a Saturday given they're busy and I'm not in the market.  But, with the invite, I did."
2300,"Personal preference to be sure:  the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started.  The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up."
2301,"Bradd...you know, I should have looked at the brand and model of tires, but didn't.  Sorry!"
2302,Just recently talked to a long time BMW enthusiast; he has always owned the latest and greatest M3 or M5- and even crewed on a BMW LSR attempt. He told me that he now drives a CTS Vsport. I asked him why and his answer was:
2303,So I guess it's not just me.
2304,"That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often.  My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary.  One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing.  Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy.  It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs.  It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience.  We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years.  As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded."
2305,I'm guessing that BMW's monthly check was bumped up a bit.
2306,"Mark....personally, I think Cadillac has done a great job of integrating the media/GPS/info screen into the dash.  No pop ups.  Looks like it belongs there."
2307,graphicguy -
2308,"Ray....would love to hear your thoughts.  BTW....how's the Charger doing?  Every time I see one on the road, I think of yours."
2309,"I like the V8 Charger a lot, thanks.  No issues at almost 4,000 miles."
2310,Check the number and placement of BMW ads in that magazine & you'll find your answer.
2311,"I love the way that many people literally accuse these mags of accepting bribes to slant reviews and then turn around and use these same mags as sources.  Count the ads???  If you make the accusation why don't you count the ads and prove your point.  I'm not naive but I tire of the off the cuff indictments without ever citing any actual proof.  The mags might not always be right but ""monthly checked was bumped""?  Please."
2312,"I read the same thing this weekend.  Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination.  Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again.  I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up."
2313,"I'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this.  I wonder, if Joe Smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so GM and C/D lawyers know where to send a complaint.  If so, what would be a length of a legal disclaimer before or after such statement followed of course by another one from the station itself."
2314,"I just looked at a random ATS incentive.  They have 750 loyalty, but 1500 conquest cash.  Way to go - tell your current customers they aren't as valuable, that you like these BMW owners more."
2315,"That's more a sign of over production that slow sales.  Unfortunately, there often isn't any correlation."
2316,Cute.  After the fact.
2317,In their May issue
2318,"In Cadillac's case, perception IS NOT reality. It's going to take some time to shake the grat Uncle image.  That said, the one enticement that got me to wtite a check was my car's low $40s selling price."
2319,Edmunds' test of an S3:
2320,How timely of Edmunds to post this.  Can't really take issue with any of it.
2321,I mentioned the RPM at cruising speeds in the S3.
2322,"Are you sure?    That doesn't seem possible, though slushboxes do some weird stuff.."
2323,"""I'll put my CTS up against a $60K+ E series or 5 series any day....and be glad I bought the Caddy."""
2324,I have verified:
2325,"There is no excuse for what Audi has apparently done to you, you should name names to Audi of America's customer service dept. and recommend pink slips for those people."
2326,"Having spent some time in the sport seats of a E90 car, I liked my M Sport Seats in my 330 (E46) better, I wish BMW would allow the M car seats to be an option, those are true sport seats."
2327,"Not worth my time, nor my effort.  Irony of ironies, the guy who was running Audi at the time I was having all the problems with the S4, is now the head honcho at Cadillac."
2328,This. I don't really want highly bolstered fully adjustable sport seats -- but I also don't want couch seats in my car. Audi is certainly failing here and it sounds like BMW is as well. Funny how years ago it was the high end cars with the good seats and the plebian cars with the flat seats. Seems like it has reversed.
2329,"Those 3-series sports seats are not highly bolstered.  They ain't Recaros, if you know what I mean, nothing crazy.   They are just well-bolstered, as opposed flat ones in the standard version.  To me they should be standard, especially in a model that sells itself as ""Ultimate Driving Machine""."
2330,I have to ask - was it also shared expenses?
2331,Exactly!
2332,Agreed!
2333,"The best seats I have ever had are in my current 2014 Audi S4; my wife's SQ5 seats are about 99% as good as my S4's, too -- before that, I enjoyed excellent seats in:"
2334,"Yes, shared expenses.  However, I drove it the most, and had my time wasted with 3 of the 4 tow truck trips it required in 65,000 miles.  Time is money."
2335,"Here is Bloomberg's review of Acura ILX.  Utterly devastating.  My favorite is comparison with Honda Civic with line ""one has inflated sense of itself, the other does not""."
2336,He really didn't like that car.  Interesting.  I have read reviews that found the car as a well regarded upgrade from the previous version of the ILX.
2337,Hack job.  I liked it.  Well loaded.  Quick. Handles and rides well.   Sounds like badge snobbery.
2338,"To be honest, that is the kind of review I would expect from a ""lifestyle"" writer:"
2339,Hannah Elliot is a woman  I read her review on the ILX. She should of compared her basis to  the LX Accord that sells for 20k Not a Civic. Check out her review on the New Audi S3. ( not a bad job ). But  I would take some of her Reviews / comments with a grain of salt.
2340,"""Acura was a way to compete against Toyota’s Lexus marque."""
2341,""". . .to further humble the Germans . . ."" The word I honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled."
2342,"I don't know if they were better.  I liked them more, for reasons you so eloquently stated.  I would add the steering feedback as first and foremost reason.  Then it will be followed by the usual laundry list, such as said RFTs, lack of manual transmission, or nicer sounding engine (pertains to lower end 3-series) and less expensive (which is true for all cars and brands).   Now, that may not be ""better"", but I liked it more.  Doesn't preclude me from buying it again for simple reason that others don't make what I like, either."
2343,"Well acura came out in 1985. Audi was pretty humbled back in those days. I'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand."
2344,"Maybe, but I although I can't speak to the ILX (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), I can speak to the TLX with an extremely similar drive train; which I've test driven twice now."
2345,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines."
2346,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste.  BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus.  I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him.  Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money.  BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more."
2347,"Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward)."
2348,"I think you've hit the nail on the head.  If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership."
2349,How about . . . I start . . .
2350,"No women in heaven, huh?"
2351,"Mark, et. al.  When I used the words, ""further humbled,"" my thinking was along the lines of the effect of the Japanese mfgs. moving upmarket and the perceived value propositions of the German marques to the general public.  I believe, and certainly more so due to the original Lexus LS after Honda fired the first shot, that the Germans were a bit surprised by the reviews and acceptance of the fancy Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans."
2352,"Currently renting a brand spanking new Jetta from Avis. A fairly stripper model, not even a sunroof."
2353,Ha!
2354,"The thing that ticks me off with the Audis at this point is that the best seats in the house are, for mere mortals (financially) in the S4 with the upgrade option, mine in red!  To next experience such chairs, you skip over the A6 and go straight to the S6 -- which, let's get real, usually is tickling the underbelly of $80,000."
2355,"The base seats in my wife's E36, E39, and E83 were fine for all but ""brisk"" driving; the E90 base seats are more like park benches. In Europe the sport seats are a standalone option, but in the US you have to get the Sport/M Sport package. Fine for me, but my wife doesn't want/need the staggered summer rubber or the M Sport suspension(which admittedly feels a bit brittle with RFTs)."
2356,"I'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of 3-series and 4-series buyers are there for the badge.  I said repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me.  many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace.  I'll admit that F3x standard seats are improved over E9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard.  I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option.  That is truly pathetic.  Now I hear Audi has gone same way?  The world is ending, no doubt."
2357,"I always made fun at American manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat.  It was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainstream here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". Just a look at an old Chevy, Buick, or Ford (GM was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt.  Seems American public learned since then and so did the manufacturers."
2358,"I believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with Sport/M-Sport package.  I don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order.  You can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, Sport/M Sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats).  To get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to pony up another $1000 for their adaptive M-sport stuff.  So there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension."
2359,"The standard seats in the XF are pretty good.  While not ""Sport"" seats, I feel they lean in that direction with decent bolstering on the sides and the seat itself.  The ""Bonded"" leather can be a bit slippery, but I stay pretty much in place when the road curves.  I really wish the seat bottom had thigh support/adjustments though.  I find the cushion just a hair short and I'd prefer more support/adjustment.  The XK had the multiple adjustable seats, everything was adjustable.  Fabulous.  I would have had to have sprung for the $4k Portfolio pkg. in the XF to get those seats, the only option my XF does not have."
2360,Buick's reputation for being more reliable than other GM cars may have been severely tarnished by someone actually letting the RPM gauge go past 3K or pushing the throttle past 33%.
2361,"I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4."
2362,assuming the Dodge doesn't break down before the weekend's out......
2363,"You need to get over your ""I got screwed by a Neon"" complex..."
2364,...by putting him into a Hellcat or an SRT 392 for the weekend.
2365,"Every single manufacturer has gone through significant changes (for better or worse) since the mid-90's when you owned your Neon.  In fact, if things hadn't changed I'd be right there with you.  My first car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT (bought brand new) which had a myriad of problems that concluded with the loeb of the camshaft (2nd from the top) completely wearing down at 61K miles.  For years I swore off GM and Domestics in general.  I'm sure I even vowed at one point (most likely on these boards) to never set foot in a D3 dealership again.  Durability and reliability have increased tremendously across the board.  Horsepower numbers are up (and so is weight).  Significant weight loss seems to be the next trend.  Each manufacturer does make a performance oriented car that given proper modifications will perform very well at the track.  There are very few cars out there that are ""no compromise."""
2366,The part that bugs me the most is that it wasn't even his car.  It was his parents'.  I figure his grandkids will be the ones to give up the grudge.
2367,"I would rather buy a Mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30K and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price."
2368,I'll just pour more fuel on the fire; my wife liked the seats in the Fiat 500 Pop we rented better than the E90's seats. Ditto for the chairs in my 1999 Wrangler Sahara.
2369,"Heck...if I can get over my Cadillac aversion, anyone can get over whatever prejudice with any car model/company."
2370,"Seat update: there is an Audi A6 (not S6, A6) seat option that does, mostly, mitigate my complaints about the flat, slick bucket seats that are standard equipment."
2371,Now
2372,I really like that edition of the TSX - in many ways better than my same vintage TL.
2373,"Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 ("
2374,"It's not just the Neon that was a bad model, take a look at Calibers, PT Cruisers, Darts (problems in Edmunds' own long term tester) Stratus', Cirrus', Pacifica's, and more."
2375,"First of all, it was a shared car; meaning it wasn't just my Parents'.  It was shared ownership.  Second of all, have things more than name changes really changed?  Neon = PT Cruiser = Caliber = Dart.   Yes, lots of name changes, but have the head gaskets and AC compressors improved?  Yes, they have more than 3 automatic gears now, but has reliability increased?   They still sit at the bottom of any credible source on reliability."
2376,"The jury is still out with your Cadillac though.  Let's see if your aversion returns by the time you get to say.... 65,000 miles.    Again, Edmunds' long term testers just a few years ago from Cadillac had parts flying/falling off, rattling, coming apart, and generally unacceptable problems."
2377,I think the Neon experience was so bad that I have no patience left in this lifetime for an unreliable car.  Another unreliable car would quickly vanish from my possession.  I am risk averse to unreliable possibilities.
2378,"I would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials AND fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the GLI is pretty much you get what you get."
2379,"I notice the benefits of AWD every time I stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in RWD and excessive wheel spin in FWD.  I especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet."
2380,"I think that's why I'm anti-Audi right now.  If they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping list."
2381,"Mark, BMW allows people to add options that are not normally available on US cars, but this has to get the blessing of BMWNA, example, if you order a 328i Luxury Line, you can get the sport seats for $500. Infact many CA are not aware of this, I just found out that Tanszanite Blue  Metallic ( an M car color) can be had on any BMW, for $1950, Rick and I both really like the color, I would assume if we got that color on the 328i GT it would be the only one in the US. What I was getting at, was, contact Audi NA and see if getting sport seats are allowed and if Audi will give you the blessing on this option. Doesn't hurt to ask."
2382,"I'll take it even further, the Sport seats on the F30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the E90 cars or E46 cars. I think people need to remember is, not everybody tracks their cars, so sport seats aren't needed. Dino, how many times as your wagon seen the track or driven to the point in which those Sport Seats where really needed?"
2383,You obviously never sat in them.  Track has nothing to do with it.  Good bolstering and correct profile are useful everywhere. I'm not talking about some supersporty Recaros - just decent bottom cushion with extended thigh support (which is probably my most favorite thing about this particular seat) and well-profiled back cushions keeping you in place as you turn the car on signals at any speeds with the back profile having adjustable lumbar support that doesn't kill your back after 200 miles.
2384,"They'll get over it.  IMHO, the Flying Spur has some resemblance to a late 90's A8.  The Continental has some last gen 9-5 in the rear as well."
2385,"Regarding American cars recapturing the luxury end of the market, I think any new names will have to make sure that affluent 40-50 year olds take notice.  ""Continental"" fortunately shares an alliance with Bentley heritage."
2386,I have to assume that the reason these players (and many others) offer AWD options for their F and R drive models is first and foremost a marketing/market penetration decision.
2387,"I agree with this, the problem I saw with the Caddy wagon was the interior room was on the small side, rear leg room was horrible... I still like the MB wagon, has a nice look to it but then it only comes in AWD.."
2388,"Let's get the name correct, Ford for some stupid reason is calling it a Lincoln Continental, personally I think the Lincoln name needs to be dropped, make the new Continental something you want as aspire to own.."
2389,Just as people became over confidence with ABS stopping their car faster...
2390,"""It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior"
2391,"I respectfully disagree.  It makes no sense for Ford to create a new ""brand.""  The cost would be prohibitive."
2392,"Perhaps we'll see names like Capri, Mark, Town Car come back?  Versailles, probably not.  I do miss the days when most car names were not some combination of letters, numbers.  There were some great names like Wildcat, Galaxie, DeVille, Starfire, Skylark, Imperial, Fury, etc."
2393,"Continental has a storied name.  Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses).  At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand.  Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model)."
2394,Mark...I never would have pegged you as a fan of teen pop songs......(j/k).
2395,I read somewhere that Ford was thinking of starting prices in the $75K range for the Continental.
2396,"Continental is not a new Brand for Ford, look at Fords history and you will see it."
2397,"Having owned a true Continental, they were cars in which people aspired to own, It wasn't until the mid 60's in which Lincoln and Continental shared the same name. Lincoln has started to turn itself around but to offer a car to start in the 70's it shouldn't have a Lincoln name attached to it."
2398,"I did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the MARKET has determined the automatics, NOT the stick shifts are superior.  This, however is not said with sarcasm."
2399,"By the way, for those who poo-poo AWD and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does Porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with AWD?"
2400,"AWD doesn't erode performance-- it actually helps performance, but it's just not related very much to handling and braking--in some cases, detrimental to it.   There are Porsche drivers and Porsche drivers, and each chooses his weapon depending on the battle he wishes to fight.  Something for everybody---that's good marketing."
2401,I am quite aware that Continental was once a distinct brand tate Ford used.  It existed for only two years before being folded into Lincoln in 1957.
2402,Maybe they've got their eyes on a global market for this car. Foreign buyers have no real point of reference regarding the history of the name.
2403,China is a key target market for the Continental and for Lincoln as a brand.
2404,"Count me as one who is happy to see a Lincoln that, whatever other faults it might have, has a real name, not a hodge-podge of initials.  As for the concept car it looks promising, with a Bentley-esque flair to the styling but we'll have to wait and see if the actual car looks good (toning down those silly wheels would be a good start)."
2405,Well they could do like they did with the first Lexus--undercut the competition at first by $10K-$15K and then gradually increase it if the model is popular.
2406,"Someone somewhere once said, ""Life is full of disappointments, get used to it."""
2407,"I recently visited an Audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. I noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. The ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable."
2408,"The base seats in the newer BMWs are just mediocre, at best. The seats in my wife's E90 are not anywhere near as comfortable as the seats in my MS3- never mind the sport seats in my Club Sport or the E21 Recaros in my '02. My dealer has a CPO 135i stick with every option but the Sport or M Sport package. I'd be sorely tempted were it not for that omission."
2409,"I am so spoiled, and until Saturday I didn't even know it.  The S4's seats (and I have the optional red leather upgraded ones) are both comfortable and grippy.  For years the sport seat option was a stand alone upgrade and, as I recall, was priced at $550.  Even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, I'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though."
2410,Why would anyone buy a BMW without sport seats?  Only those who haven't indulged!
2411,"Mark...I echo your sentiments about the A6 with the 3.0T and sport set up.  I felt that would be my next purchase if things had turned out better with my S4.  Not so, though.  I also agree about the seats....nowhere near what I want.  But, everything is a compromise.  The A6 with the S4 motor is screaming cruiser."
2412,"I'm sure you just mistyped, stick, but balance and handling are not dependent on the driven wheels. Better acceleration traction in all conditions? Yes. That's it."
2413,AWD instead of FWD.  wasn't comparing to RWD here.
2414,"I couldn't have said it better, but of course, the buying public and even people in this forum have bought the package that if you live in an area that gets snow, then you must have AWD..."
2415,"So now that we are beating a dead horse again,"
2416,"I disagree.  Handling is absolutely affected by driven wheels.  Try to enter a corner at excessive speed, then hit brakes or accelerator at different times and see how the car reacts.  Depending on the propelled wheels, it will do different things."
2417,And the main problem with Audis is that I just keep hearing not so good things about long term reliability & customer service.  From our own
2418,Don't forget driver100's clutch failure at 10k miles...
2419,buying a used on does scare me.  Nice cars though.  Most likely it would never be something that would end up being my choice (unless I was leasing possibly).  Though I did find a really nice looking one recently.  It's Purty.
2420,I agree.  They are nice looking.  Well finished & drive great.  But a risk no less.
2421,"Well, the old Integra R dominates the old Impreza RS at the autocross."
2422,"Sorry, I should have said ""better handling"" is not dependent on driven wheels. Yes, they will handle differently, but not necessarily better."
2423,"To each his own I guess is the final say. I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD.  Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal.  He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way."
2424,"When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving."
2425,"Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't consider AWD  a need but I find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  It always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in Florida or Arizona for example.  I have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  And like I said, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  Ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the Midwest. But slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic."
2426,Subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons.  First it wasn't a great seller.  Second was the fact that it's MPG wasn't that great and affected their CAFE number.  The Outback is considered an SUV and it's MPG doesn't count against CAFE.
2427,I understand why Subaru dropped the wagon. It doesn't mean I have to be happy with that decision
2428,"Cadillac dropped their wagon, too.  It had a lot of good press. Unfortunately, there's still that stigma that goes with wagons."
2429,"I always saw it the other way..    the Mercedes wagon people were ""old money"", that just bought a wagon, because they wanted a wagon...     The S-class people were the ""nouveau riche""."
2430,"Me too.  E Class wagons were for those with old, moldy money.  They also had a Grand Wagoneer at the shore house."
2431,"I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches.""  My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo.  Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL).  I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time?  Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going.  Of course, ground clearance is another factor..."
2432,"Oh, yeah.  And what's cool is that most of the time the XF has a RWD bias, I believe it is 90% of the torque goes to the rear axle.  Pushing the snow button changes it to 30/70 with the computer deciding upon when to make it 50/50."
2433,"So will the new Continental be an ELLPS?  V6, AWD, big 19"" wheels......"
2434,No EL in that.  And those wheels are hideous.
2435,"Well the definition is all over the place now so if it starts under $40, it's EL."
2436,"My guess is the new Continental will be a top of the line model with a starting msrp north of 50k. But, with the likely rebates and discounts you might be able to score a ""base"" model in the low 40s....Guilty pleasure, I guess, but I think it looks pretty good. But kinda wish they'd gone with ""suicide"" doors lol...."
2437,Absolutely
2438,"Yes, that's right, AWD does not improve handling...it improves acceleration. Which is where I got the idea of ""over confidence"" from---that you might end up going faster than you can safely stop."
2439,"Bentley has their panties all up in a bunch over this car.  Lincoln has given it the go ahead, BTW.  Have no idea on pricing.  Supposed to be on a stretched Fusion platform.  So, see this at your LINCOLN dealer sometime in the near future."
2440,"Big, FWD(or FWD biased AWD), expensive for  what you get- yawn..."
2441,"I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison."
2442,"Mark every car magazine has disproved this whole ""If you live in snow country, you need AWD"" Car's today and the electronic nannies have helped so much that AWD isn't really needed, plus these same magazines have shown how people have a false sense of security with these cars."
2443,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
2444,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
2445,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time."""
2446,"All good points.  The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens.  Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent,  Cruise, Fiesta, etc.  Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc.  Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything.  That's how they get to those price points."
2447,Lots of us open the moonroof all the time.  And many people that don't still open the shade to get more light in.  Especially important in the typical German black cave interior!
2448,"Started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" However, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. That's why I've been stressing BASE MSRP. I absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples."
2449,"Q nailed it. These are the models to get the budget challenged into the category/brand. Not the highest performance or most luxurious, but with reasonable quantities of both. Size is not that important.  Nor is drivetrain configuration. Badge and price are."
2450,"My son is a good example.  First job, new car, tight finances. He got a Jetta. SE. Wanted a GLI, but got in fold and hooked on German cars.   Already planning next one. Drools on an S3.  Will probably settle for an A3.  After that, will depend on how his budget (and family if one comes along) grows!  But he does aspire to move up the ladder."
2451,"Other than AWD and a few extra HP, what's the difference between the GLI and the A3?"
2452,"Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand.  For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL."
2453,"Back to AWD, I can understand why you might want one in the mountains or the Northeast; but even in my neck of the woods people spring for AWD.(the reason we have a Jeep and and an X3 truck is because our 1500' gravel driveway rarely sees a plow- but note that my Wrangler made it through over 18"" of snow in 2WD thanks to BFG All Terrain KO tires with the Severe Snow rating)."
2454,"I was going to say ""4 rings"".  Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY).  Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
2455,"Yeah, well since he said ""besides AWD and a few extra HP"" I didn't address the AWD part.  But that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods."
2456,Perhaps the young man should reevaluate his date if that's what the measure she uses....
2457,Any AWD system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver.
2458,"So many times I hear someone say:  ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow.""  For the longest time I responded with:  ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems.""  That usually got the ""deer in the headlights stare"" at which point I would just say:  ""You are right.  you need AWD or 4WD."""
2459,"Yep- the ""wearers."""
2460,"If given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, I would choose the AWD vehicle every time.  People always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"".   Actually getting tired of hearing that.  And there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"".  Do I need AWD in the winter around Chicago?.....not really.  Is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions?  Yes, it is very nice to have.   Of course, I can get around without AWD as I occasionally drive my RWD v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."
2461,"Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps. If you doubt this, I invite you to talk to any tow truck driver who operates in or near a popular ski area. If nothing else, and it doesn't convince you, you'll get some entertaining stories."
2462,"I have got to tell you, the more I think about it, the more I like the Audi S3 Premium Plus.  Look at the standard features you get:"
2463,"Only if the lady in question is a snob .. she might prefer the VW due to the IQ of the owner, understanding the value..."
2464,And I'd rather get a Golf R - all of the above (I think) and the practicality of a hatch!
2465,"""Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps."""
2466,That does seem to be a nice price for the S3.  Is that price good for all that equip??
2467,"Bradd, from reading about the ride on that, you might not enjoy it on the I95 bomb craters very much."
2468,"AWD is not just snow.  Vs. FWD, it can also give better handling and balance on wet roads. And dry.  The WRX is AWD for a reason!"
2469,You nailed it!
2470,Because it's a Subaru and the purists would have a conniption if it were anything else!!
2471,I go away for awhile and look what happens....we're debating the definition of an acronym.  LOL!
2472,Well let's go back to my list and note the sizes based on EPA standards:
2473,Some more than others.
2474,"I don't pay any attention to what category the EPA puts a car in.  Heck, they classify the Bentley 12 cyl as a compact car.  Don't think too many people look at one of those and say ""boy, that's a sharp compact car""."
2475,"Actually, the ILX/A3/CLA/1-series are subcompacts. Then you have your compacts (A4, C-class, 3-series, ATS), your midsize (5-series, etc), and your full-size (7-series, etc). There is the microcar class below all of that, but the luxo players haven't ventured there yet."
2476,I like the above take from
2477,Except that the ILX and CLA are both considered compacts by the EPA.  So are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?
2478,"They are? Huh. Where do I look that info up? Because I tried fueleconomy.gov and they list the Aston Rapide S as subcompact, so methinks that's not a reliable source."
2479,Well the EPA is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source.  Here is the link:
2480,"I really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the EPA designates a car.    Manufacturers seldom market their cars using the EPA categories."
2481,I'm sure that not consulting the EPA class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers.  But it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured.  The fuel economy listed on the Munroney sticker uses it as a guide.
2482,"Agree, now that I know how its done, EPA classes are useless."
2483,"""You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category."""
2484,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA."
2485,It seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them.  So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand.   I wasn't impressed with either the CLA or the ILX at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
2486,"My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:"
2487,I agree with goldie-
2488,Coming Soon
2489,"This was a few years ago, but I was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new Mustang GT.  Not a slow car by any stretch.  Until, I got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an F150 in the next lane."
2490,"Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser. I also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. Right now I'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious Grand Tourer. In either case it will almost certainly be a RWD coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
2491,"I think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is MSRP, who pays MSRP?  So a 320i with premium package, Leather, Sport Package and Lighting Package $41,400. Can be had easily for $38,400 and right now BMW has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with  manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more.. With mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m"
2492,Nobody is missing the point.  Everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons.  That's why people use MSRP for reference.  It's like using the EPA MPG numbers.  Everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the EPA numbers are best to use.  There is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to MSRP for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32.  Better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
2493,exactly. And deals vary throughout the year. MSRP is the only way that makes consistent sense.
2494,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible?  I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria."
2495,"I like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it. Talk about sport all you want- and I like the MS3 becaus in many ways it's a better car then the 320. The Manual 320 (never driven) Prob a nice rig,328 manual even better I guess.  Talk lease leader ad deals- guys who get 10-15k of cts - but real world when you need a car you take msrp and subtract an amount- usually 10-% or less depending on car. I love cars- I love cars with passion more. Do you feel the love (tonight?)"
2496,"BMW is all about the lease payment.  I was not a typical customer for them, since I don't lease.  When I bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase.  He said they always negotiated payment.  He's a good guy.  Whenever I walk into the dealership, he knows I'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires.  We go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and MSRP on it."
2497,"I could be talked into $45k, which allows the 335i, but not the 335ix. I could go either way, frankly. I think $40k would make more sense after BMW releases a smaller class here in the US to compete with the CLA/A3"
2498,"What is the issue with the base price?  The class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about.  The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact.  If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's.  These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller.  In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series."
2499,I think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as CPO BMWs for the low to mid $20K.
2500,"Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here.  You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker.  They said so repeatedly.  It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford.  For myself, I don't look at cars at their base.  If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me.  I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it.  But that vantage point difference is very real.  I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5.  I totally disagree on M or RS.  There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering.  ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size?  Porsches are even smaller, so what?  That's not enough."
2501,"I can't remember the words ""performance"" and ""Lincoln"" being used in the same sentence since the demise of the Mark VII LSC in the early '90s."
2502,'.. since the demise of the Mark VII LSC in the early '90s.'
2503,Good catch- that would DEFINITELY be an ELLPS- it slipped what's left of my mind...
2504,The ILX doesn't have the option to power the other wheels nor the upgrade the power plant.
2505,"IMHO, it doesn't meet the criteria of being able to corner without inducing intestinal distress or the puckering of one's sphincter."
2506,"I think, I agree.  Never heard of anybody trying to toss it into a corner.  Mr. McConaughey is shown strolling down the boulevard at quite pedestrian pace, so the intended use is quite clear.  It's not wrong, but it's not sports, or performance, even withh 300 horses."
2507,"I think ATS, bigger size and increased pricing did that already."
2508,"Is the common thought that, for example, the A3 is an ELLPS but the A4 is not?"
2509,Of course - brain fart there.  I meant the ATS will be pushed out by a subcompact Cadillac.  I edited my post to reflect that.
2510,"Ah the Lincoln LS ... ""I drove Lincolns before anyone paid me to drive lincolns"" now I finally understand whats Specolis best friend ways saying.  The Lincoln should be added - it's sudo lux, looks pretty cool and is under 40k- no idea how it drives but seems similar to the others -and if you add a Buick then this should be fair game."
2511,I haven't driven a Lincoln MKZ but I understand it is has similar underpinnings to the Fusion which is based on the Euro Mondeo.  Reviews of the Fusion usually put it near the top in handling for mainstream midsize cars.
2512,OK - updated list:
2513,"So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much."
2514,Just for grins and giggles what are the prices if you tick every options box?
2515,OK - ticking all the boxes of what looked to be factory/port options - no dealer accessories AFAIK.
2516,"How about C-class?  Too big now, or too expensive? A4? I see, there are lower models, so they no longer need to apply.  I think it is possible to have two models in same category, if they're not differentiated ad much.  It does look like C-class is intended to move up, just as CTS.  I think A4 is still in the class, both in size and price."
2517,"I think there is a difference between sportyish mainstream sedan, like Fusion or its plush cousin (more like stepbrother) and 328, A4, or TLX.  They may not be world apart, but the separation is distinct."
2518,"The Acura ILX is about 6 inches longer than the Audi A3, and gets to 60 faster than the A3 1.8. At a little after 14 minutes in this long video Alex on Autos measures the acceleration of the ILX at 6.25 0-60, which seems to be about half a second faster than the A3 1.8. At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story...."
2519,"Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB."
2520,The ILX also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up Civic. Even though the competing models are also built on existing mainstream platforms. the ILX tends to suffer from that more than most.
2521,"ILX is still part of a luxo brand, so I say it counts regardless of driven wheels. I mean, put it this way... So a FWD A4 is not luxo, but an AWD version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? Doesn't make sense to me. They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about."
2522,Sort of.
2523,"The Mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow Ford to focus on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint.""  Which means they needed time to consolidate their European factories to stop the flow of red ink."
2524,"It's not that it's BUILT on a shared platform - as I said, most are. It's how it is perceived compared to other makes. Perhaps it's because Honda Canada commissioned a few generations of particularly awful Acura variations of the Civic that were little more than a different grille and some extra trim. Up here they are known as the Acura Civic regardless of how they're badged."
2525,"It's true that the A3 looks nothing at all like the Golf, while as much as the ILX is restyled and upgraded from the Civic, it has more trouble escaping its sibling. More than that, Audi seems to signify ""premium"" and ""prestige,"" even if a base A3 1.8 falls behind an ILX on some things while costing thousands more...."
2526,"I say the ILX counts, as well..      (though, I wouldn't choose it..)."
2527,The Ilx counts IMO for 2016 with the bigger engine and new trans. Plenty quick enough for the class.
2528,"The ""directional"" wheels on the ILX seem a little odd to me, and maybe out of place for an aspiring ELLS. I don't dislike them, exactly, but they wouldn't be my first choice. I think they're supposed to appeal to younger buyers, but for those of us old enough to remember the 80s, they seem almost nostalgic. And I wonder if the car would sell better if they just called it the Integra. In my mind, that's what I imagine the I in ILX stands for anyway...."
2529,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming).  This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS."
2530,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level.   still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors."
2531,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go?  Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7).  The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate.  But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size."
2532,I know of at least one Bavaria with an S38 motor from an E28 M5 under the hood...
2533,"OK...if we're setting rules...$45K MSRP upper limit? Acura,Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lincoln, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo are the brands?"
2534,"I agree that entry level definitely has to meet a price point.  Problem is that there is way too much over lapping within the respective companies.  The ""entry level"" price points vary as well.  Yes there is a big difference between the meat of this market of $35K - $50K on paper.  You have to factor in the fact that the majority of these cars are leased.  So many times people don't see the difference of a few thousand dollars by looking at the total cost of the lease , but rather as an extra $30, $40, $50 etc per month."
2535,"Bradd, definitely include the Volvo S60 too."
2536,Done
2537,So Bradd - only the upper model of the TLX makes the cut?  Just curious.
2538,Just my suggestions of course.  I feel like Acura's big V6 & slick AWD system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.
2539,"I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."
2540,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely  assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base)."
2541,"You forgot about 320i, Mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but according to some here, still spunky enough for their taste.  I don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still dynamic enough, so I'd add it.  In fact, I'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
2542,"Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly."
2543,Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment.
2544,"As for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention?"
2545,I stand corrected ANY 3XX denomination or derivative that keeps the L+P (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.
2546,"Once again, an M3 is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. Nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level."""
2547,"It will be $50K soon.  335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year.  435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation.  Also C400 is already above $45K."
2548,"""$69,999"""
2549,"I agree.  I think it's again in eye of the beholder.  Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances.  Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means.  Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture.  I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class.  If people buy it, so be it."
2550,I'll add to the fire:
2551,"rob, i think your logic makes perfect sense and endorse your list of vehicles completely."
2552,I too like that list.  I would support adding the Turbo regal.  Not the Lincoln though.
2553,How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?
2554,Not enough
2555,I would certainly say so.
2556,Someone thinks I make perfect sense??  Why thank you.
2557,"Acura TLX  $31,445"
2558,Just for grins and giggles what are the prices if you tick every options box?
2559,"I agree, but I was trying to be diplomatic and give a little leeway."
2560,"$45 now?  Damned, I got left behind by entry level now?  I would have gone with $35K base (before the crazy options).  Maybe 40k ""all in"""
2561,funny how we have this discussion seemingly every 6 mos or so.
2562,"And it always is the same - majority of voices have ""fantasy land"" assumptions, from wrong pricing to features, mostly due to lack of recognition in market changes.  So from one side saying that $70K+ M3 is an ""Entry Level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40K ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition.  Classic eat the cake and have it, too."
2563,"""Infiniti G50"""
2564,Not anymore.  Hence the past tense.
2565,The G35/37 have been rebadged as the Q40. Still available at your local Infiniti dealer.
2566,"Now I see my mistake, at last.  It was supposed to be G35/37, not G50.  Sorry for the mixup.  So, I meant to say G35 in its first and second generation were closest to ELLPS in their nature in last 10-15 years.  BTW, I new about the rebadging to Q40, but formally G37 it is no longer with us."
2567,"How do you remove a mistaken post completely?  I had this one posted on a wrong forum, didn't know how to take it out, so I edited it into this question."
2568,You have 4 hours .. use the gear icon.
2569,Funny thing about BMWs move upscale; my dealer has a 2011 335i manual SP that I''m considering. I pulled up the
2570,"But the Gear icon only shows me ""Edit"", I can't see any ""remove"" option."
2571,"Hmm, guess only us moderators can delete posts. You can edit the content and replace it with ""delete"" or ""null"" as I've seen others do."
2572,"I tried no content, it won't let me.  I guess if I write ""null"", it will."
2573,"Tough to define this sector, definition could be quite broad.  I imagine one would have to parse each manufacturer to determine which model is their ""entry level.""  And, then is it luxury and performance DNA?  For example, in my distant outpost in the universe known as ""Jaguar,"" I drive the current entry level Jag, the XF.  Is it entry level by definition here?  Well, if E, 5, and A6 variants are, then yes.  IMHO, it certainly has luxury and performance, but is never mentioned here.  And, a few years ago, would a BMW 3 really be ""luxury?""  Mercedes Benz was luxury, BMW covered performance and perhaps Audi was the only marque that could be included here, combining luxury and sport."
2574,"Well, 10 years ago it was probably the 328i and g35 as the definitive examples.  So extrapolate that and see what you get!"
2575,"""Entry Level Luxury"" in this forum and others usually implied not in a lineup of the maker, but versus wallets of the potential buyers.  Those ""ELL"" basically meant ""premium brand plus some, but not all latest premium features"".   Something, midlevel professional with decent job could afford, as long as they didn't buy too big house, or didn't have too many other obligations.  They also limited the size of the vehicle.  The old X-type from Jag was in that category, but they withdrew from that market completely and now cater to what I would call ""full premium to upscale"" segment with a performance skew into it.  Those sometimes were called LPS, or ""Luxury Performance Sedans""."
2576,"So the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it.  The former means ELLPS is now $45-$60K on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury.  The latter means the ""founders"" don't qualify today by either being too expensive, too big, too soft, or all of the above.  I'm sure there will be plenty of arguments both ways."
2577,"personally, I would say its an ""either/or"" kind of statement. Its the least expensive sedan on a luxo makers shelf AS LONG AS the base price doesn't exceed $40k. I'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, Jag's XF was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
2578,Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.
2579,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook.  How could anyone possibly define that?"
2580,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit.  If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more."
2581,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3."
2582,"Dino, I think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them.  Pretty sure that an A3 is roughly the size (and mission) of the A4 from a couple of generations ago.  And would not be surprised if the ILX is close to the original TSX.  BMW though has not (as far as I recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
2583,"Oh yes, they did.  Quite a bit.  Current 3-series is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one.  15 years ago the 5-series was EPA classified as ""compact"".  Today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
2584,"Good to know.  I knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much."
2585,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003).  It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series."
2586,"I wholeheartedly disagree. An entry-level job is salary-dependent, as is an entry-level house. Why should an entry-level vehicle not follow suit? If the grouping were dependent on size, the title would use car size classification and it would be called ""Compact Luxury Performance Sedans."""
2587,"I am with Q on this.  To me, the EL is absolutely cost-dependent."
2588,'My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0' - roadburner.
2589,"I second that.  Entry level has a money-related conotation in every single product, job, title, service I know.  The only exception I can think of would be in hobby or leisure activity, where it would mean novice, or begginer.  In vehicles, M3  or S4 is not entry level in anything. It is compact, or not large, but certainly not entry level.  Perhaps in some rich exclusive country club, it could, when they would need somebody else vouch for me in my lowly 328, but a M3 owner may be let in without an usher escort watching the silverware..."
2590,Ray I have had many Chargers and Challengers as rental and ever since the 8 spd was installed and some of then newer tweeks they have become good cars.. Enjoy
2591,Precisely.
2592,I'd take a Charger R/T with the Road and Track package over an F10 every time.
2593,"Can you say ""flash counter?"" To paraphrase a post on an E90 board, You can quote Magnuson-Moss all you want, but if  the turbos start whining or the HPFP acts strange BMW will claim that increasing the power over stock was the cause of the failure. They have lawyers and professionals on retainer to support their position."
2594,"I wasn't aware I could have gotten an X1 for $23,800:)-  My Legacy is light on options (cloth seats, slick top, no navigation).  So probably for the same price as a loaded Legacy 3.6R limited I could buy an X1.  For the price of most 320xi sedans sitting on dealer lots, I could factory order an X1 35i with minimal options and really have some fun on my commute:)"
2595,"""I'd take a Charger R/T with the Road and Track package over an F10 every time. """
2596,Take them both to an HPDE and see who ends up laughing.
2597,"Yeah, if you can stay off the lots and out of the lease question boards, you'll keep your Pilot."
2598,So now you are using the experience from E90 and the bible for the F30?
2599,Your payments would be the same if you got the X1.
2600,Please explain how anything I wrote would not apply to an F30.
2601,"HA!  You are 100% right my friend!  Between the lease question board, the Incentives & Rebates menu under the Car research tab this is a very dangerous place for me to be hanging out!  I also qualify for USAA rebates now too so that adds fuel to the fire.  As long as I stay away from the dealership, then I'm OK."
2602,"You are probably right.  I drive a little more than 20K per year.  Once you start figuring out leases with that kind of mileage, they start to not look so cheap anymore.  I'm not completely opposed to leasing either given the right circumstances.  I know my wife for instance DOES NOT like driving her Pilot.  She does maybe 12K per year.  I'm sure once her truck is paid for in a few years and the principle is paid down on my Legacy, she's going to want something.  So I could always lease her something nice (like an E-Class, BMW 5er, or Lexus GS) and then buy it out for myself once the Legacy starts to get up there in mileage."
2603,"Aaah!   With such a slow couple days on the Chronic Car Buyers forum, I found everyone was over here!  I used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven't found my way over here for awhile."
2604,"Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though. It is one thing to have a factory-authorized tune installed by the dealer, and another to do it yourself at home, regardless of the programming parameters. Upping the boost is but a portion of the big picture."
2605,"He told me there are at least 3 levels of information stored in the car's computer. The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that."
2606,"Back when Erik Wensberg was BMW M Brand Manager he told me a story about a 5 speed E36 M3 that had been flat bedded into a dealership. The owner-whose previous car was an Oldsmobile-said he was simply ""driving down the interstate at 65 mph when the car just died"". Unfortunately for the owner(and his wallet), the DME was interrogated and it revealed a final engine speed in excess of 9000 rpm."
2607,"Could I ask the question: what (now, today) is an ELLPS?"
2608,"Buick Regal GS and Lincoln MKZ?  Buick is more a premium brand as it stands below Cadillac but Lincoln is surely recognized as the luxury division of FoMoCo.  Dodge is certainly not a luxury brand but Chrysler could be considered, like Buick, a premium brand but wouldn't be considered a luxury brand.  Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in."
2609,There's a confluence of car brands that are starting to blur the lines of ELLS.
2610,Agree 100%.
2611,"If the ELPps is supposed to be entry level you can exclude most mentioned above. The said above companies are using lower letters /numbers for a reason. A3,ats, ILX- sure others I think need to be adjusted - price should matter along with what the manufacturer is telling you."
2612,"One response: concerning the IS but not the ES.  The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance.  There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole.""  The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me."
2613,"I still can't grasp a $50K car (or more) qualifying for the EL piece (entry level).  Which is why an S4 to me is not in the class.  An A3 (or A4) could be.  a 320i, yes, a loaded 335?  no."
2614,"This is why the definition of what a ELLPS really is, each one of us has out own criteria, we have beat this topic to death... But I do think there is a blurring line between ELLS and ELLPS at times."
2615,"I agree the 335 could not be included becSue it's not entry level  same with s4.. Ie cheaper . The ""el cheapo"" (not my term), a3, buicks whatever, ilx, maybe the 328 and lower a4, the infini g37, Volvo s (or whatever it's called, weird dash)  - I think price has to be included. The Lexus IS ""el cheapo"" 250 should only be included if you want a passionless car. Performance and Price right- ???"
2616,"OK...if we're setting rules...$45K MSRP upper limit?  Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lincoln, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo are the brands?"
2617,I gotta ask - which Porsche model retails for under $45K and is a sedan?
2618,none.
2619,Acura?
2620,No.....!
2621,"After 25K miles no issues with steering, I guess myself and the other 500K people who have a F30 are just lucky we haven't gotten into an accident.."
2622,"I've never said it's an awful car, but it does lacks a quality that used to be standard issue across the entire BMW model line. And it's a capability that I-and others on the more enthusiastic side of the automotive spectrum-think is an important facet of the driving experience. You don't, and you like your F30. That's understandable, but don't get yourself in a lather when some of us are less than enamored with the platform's driving dynamics- especially when it is fitted with the base suspension.."
2623,"To shift gears a bit(no pun intended), I hope to do a bit more instructing this year. I find it helpful to read/re-read some of the classic books on track driving. I decided to start with Piero Taruffi's"
2624,2.0t rut ro ????? Drama killing me.
2625,Why on God's Green Earth?  I'll tell  you why
2626,"Hertz rents the Hertz Mustang GT as well as C7 or the Camero SS, I know they have them at the airport location, so if you really want a fun for that weekend, I would have taken one of them. I know when I flew into San Diego, I was always temped to just one for the few days I was going to be in town."
2627,So what you are saying is that the Camaro (at least that model) isn't really a sports car but a poser car. I concur.
2628,"I recently rented a BMW 328, admittedly a low end model, and I was very unimpressed by the steering feel. Frankly (and seriously), our 2007 Mazda 5 microvan has much better steering feel than that BMW did."
2629,"The BMW 320i has 180 hp, while the 328i has 240 hp. I wondered what differences in the engine could account for that 60hp, but according to this article probably the biggest difference between the two models is in the engine software:"
2630,Now that's funny
2631,"When I test drove the IS350 F sport, I've mentioned that I liked it quite a bit.  But, like my previous TL, you have to spur it a bit into the upper revs to get any torque."
2632,"Gotcha.  I remember your S4 getting hit, fixed, fixed again, & fixed some more.  You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new."
2633,"As we all know, Hyundai not surprisingly has had some trouble selling its luxury models. An extreme example is found at my local dealer, which still has one last 2013 (!) Genesis, which I think is a demo. Not surprisingly, they are offering a huge discount on it of almost $11,000. They are also offering $8k off msrp on some 2014s. The 2013 is a fully loaded Genesis 5.0 V-8 ""R-spec"" model with all the options, and it can be yours for just $37k. I guess it's lot of car for the money....(maybe too much?):"
2634,Ditto for my Mazdaspeed 3.
2635,Have you ever dealt with Oxmoor Hyundai? They probably have a $9000 Mop 'n Glow ADM sticker to spring on the hapless customer...
2636,"Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day.  That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you.  Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track.  I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track.  I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track.  Although I did recently have all the necessary fluids (oil, brake, trans, differential) fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wife's 2011 Pilot.  Maybe I should bring it up to LR and see what it can do:)"
2637,"It's not as simple.  Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it.  The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere.  Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract?  I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract.  So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance.  Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too.  It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent."
2638,"""but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing"""
2639,The 320i has been dynoed and it was putting 180 to RW... This was done by Terry at BMS. Then add the BMS Stage1 which add's 3 lbs of boost you are talking about 220 RW. Right about where the 328i is at.
2640,Back to renta car talk above....I think I would of went with the Buick - imagine being the guy with the Buick.....helmet in hand ..Sirius 50's station blasting
2641,"The fact that I -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model BMW) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our critiques.  ""It used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective.  It is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however."
2642,"Brad, it does void the warranty, and when you write info like that without having first hand knowledge only adds more issues."
2643,It's called the lowest common denominator -- mass appeal.
2644,"Since I decided against an S3 a while back, I have rarely been to this forum.  As usual, I find Markcincinnati’s posts thought-provoking.  He mentions BMW [ I had one ] ‘the good old days’ [ I was there ] and steering feel, among other things."
2645,"This is true.  I don't have any first hand knowledge.  Don't get me wrong, I do think it is cool that you modified your 320i.  I'm still sticking with my position that I'd take an X1 for basically the same money with the 240 hp (from the factory) version of the N20."
2646,"Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too. When it comes to undetectable codes I can only go by what I have read by many on bimmerfest,"
2647,"I'm glad you like the X1, which you could have gotten for about the same price as your current care, but the X1 is just WAY too small for me, being 6 ft there is no back seat room."
2648,"Q....that's not far off from what I'm getting on my 2.0T.  Admittedly, I keep my foot in it, but that mileage is exemplary."
2649,"Most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"".  Complete with flames."
2650,5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. To be considered very fast these days I'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. The goalposts have moved quite a bit.
2651,"To each his own, my tweaked MS3 is only a tick faster; I can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."
2652,The ilx at 6.2 is a dog.
2653,"Same here; it really feels different from the newer cars. Contrast that with the X6 I drove at the press intro a few months ago- it was pretty quick but dull as dishwater to drive; a totally uninvolving steer, as the Brits would say."
2654,"You know, we've got it pretty good.  In the 80's and early 90's, a 0-60 of under 10 seconds was IMPRESSIVE."
2655,"I'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. My 1988 M6 could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a Dinan or Conforti chip. The 325i and 535i were 7 second cars, easy. The Mustang GT and Z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."
2656,"Agree with your assessment.  I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5.  The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring.  I've told him a few times that the ///M5 wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130K price point.  He couldn't swing (or should I say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150K plus for a Panamera Turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" Panamera 4S because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."
2657,"I kinda doubt one would even feel the difference between a 4.5 car and a 5.0 car.  To me, radical speed is something like the Ariel Atom, which is under 3 seconds and probably feels completely different from a 4.5 car."
2658,Would say this 0-6O just a measure - real world passing is where its at on the highway - being able to just blast the gas at 45 and loook down and see 65/70 in a blink is where its at. Did it today just to get around slower traffic: gonzo - pretty good 2/3/5/7 seconds (dk.)
2659,"European magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance.  This was especially important for manual transmission cars, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."

2661,"That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match."
2662,"Back in the day, no one ever talked about 0-60 times.  It was always quarter mile times.  I had a 69 Charger 440, which could get in the 13's with street tires, and in the 12's with slicks.  That was pretty d___ quick for a daily driver in those days."
2663,"I think if GM wants to be treated seriously by most buyers they are going to have to make cars that don't go into limp mode at a weekend HPDE (track event) when they are extremely low miles and unmodified such as the V6 Camaro I rented.  The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend."
2664,"As I said, under 10 was impressive.  I'm thinking more pedestrian vehicles."
2665,"As I said, the goalposts have moved, 13 second quarters can now be achieved in many cases with a mildly modified hot hatch."
2666,"I concur....I think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling.  Even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos.  S/Cs are even better."
2667,Why on Gd's Green Earth would you rent a V6 Camaro with an Automatic Transmission and take it to the track?  The auto enthusiasts that track their cars are so few and far between that they barely register on manufacturers' radar.  You want a Camaro suited for the track?  You local Chevrolet dealer will gladly sell you a Z/28 Camaro.
2668,It does indeed.
2669,"I disagree. My 3.6L TT CTS has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0L Mustang does, and over a wider RPM band, too. While that Coyote V8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, I always felt it was a bit weak in the low RPM range."
2670,"I think people like to stir the pot... We have car's that are faster, safer, and get better MPG then we had 10,20,30 years ago, but to call a car that can do 0-60 in 5 sec's, the 1/4 in high 14's and still get 30 on the highway is incredible. As I wrote people use to drool over my 302, but show up in a 2015 Mustang GT and those same people would walk away from the 2015 and stand next to the 1970 302 and say, this is a real muscle car...  Roadburner is the same thing, anything new BMW is junk, he loves his son's X3 because it is older.."
2671,Is that a misprint? 2.0T??
2672,"When it comes to non turbo charged cars, I agree, but when you have a force feed engine, displacement doesn't always mean weak.."
2673,"Wrong, I actually"
2674,Thats right the steering in the current BMW is so bad that no one can tell what is happening with the front wheels with the whole lack of feedback.
2675,"You will possibly not be surprised to learn that I haven't checked baggage for over 20 years, save the within-Europe flights that are very stringent about ONE ONLY carry-on bag."
2676,"Alex on Autos tests the Acura ILX as going 0-60 in 6.25 seconds, which is faster than all the other base competitors except for the MB CLA.  He seems to say the Acura 8 speed dual clutch transmission with exclusive torque converter is his favorite transmission in the segment. Comparably equipped he says that it's less than the competition by anywhere from c. $1k to c. $12k. He admits it doesn't have the prestige of the other brands, but likely has better reliability and lower insurance costs. Overall, he says Acura has got its ""mojo back."""
2677,Alex also really likes the Audi A3. The 2.0 AWD model he tests has an msrp of c. $40k.
2678,"Thanks Ben - interesting review- given discounts and power wonder if the old Infiniti g35/37 or q40 as its weirdly called now would be a better deal. I've seen locals with redic low leases and pricing under 35k, 330 hp strong v6 and premium gas being under 4 bux- I would seriously consider as a major comp to both above. Sure you are driving basically a 10 year old bmw 3 comp but no weird stearing like current infinitis and bmws."
2679,I knew there was a reason I liked the ILX.  the only thing really wrong with the original was a bit of a weak engine.  that seems to have been cured.
2680,According to Consumer Reports the new Infiniti Q is really poor reliability and not rated very well.
2681,"We had a G37 sedan (same car as the Q40) for 3 years..    Not a hiccup.    Stupid amounts of power.  Comparably poor gas mileage.   Numb handling (but adequate).    Nice interior, though a little cramped.  It's a huge amount of car for the money, especially on a lease."
2682,"Ditto on the G37x, flawless and crazy power, at the price of mpg.  The Q50 we replaced it with has had it's share of hiccups, a quirky car to say the least."
2683,"I almost forgot...   have a neighbor up the street who had a G35.   The first one with the new body style that became the G37 a year later.. so, 2008 or 2009, maybe?     Don't know how many miles, but in 2014 it blew the engine...    He said he took a $10K hit trading it in..  On a new Q50!!"
2684,Yeah I wouldn't do that again either.  We have the Q50 Hybrid so it has the venerable 3.5 engine to supplement the hybrid powertrain.  If only they could sort out the electronics.
2685,"I've put the G3x/Q50 on my shopping list more than once.  I didn't dislike the cars, matter of fact, I liked them.....the G more than the Q.  Seems I always found something I liked better."
2686,"I liked most aspects of my '04 G35X. But it ""felt"" very heavy and got horrible mileage for a 260hp V6 (averaged 21mpg). I always had more of a soft spot for the circa '06 M45."
2687,"Q....I know it's not something you buy your car for, but what kind of MPG are you getting on your V-Sport?"
2688,Just double checked CR- the old g37 now q40 still on the recommended list - the new q50 is not and first year buyers have trashed it a bit.
2689,Thanks sween - it just seems that when the G35 and then G37 came out I saw them everywhere. Now either the new version isn't selling well or it is so nondescript that I don't notice it. And why did they change their lettering on that model? I makes no sense to me - I don't have the impression Infiniti is on the upswing...
2690,"It was a marketing decision by Johan de Nysschen to bring Infiniti more in line with Audi (where he came from).  A for cars, Q for SUVs vis a vis Q for cars, QX for SUVs.  Now he is at Cadillac and we are getting CT for cars and who knows what for SUVs."
2691,"It was a marketing decision by Johan de Nysschen to bring Infiniti more in line with Audi (where he came from).  A for cars, Q for SUVs vis a vis Q for cars, QX for SUVs.  Now he is at Cadillac and we are getting CT for cars and who knows what for SUVs."
2692,"I would come up with a resurrected restyled G. It's a nice idea to have a good naming convention but not IMHO if you tarnish the goodwill and brand recognition of an existing car (G35/37). They could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer G, and rename to the G39 or something like that. Those original taillights were very distinctive and I could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. And then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes CU and reviewers to not like the new one not so much."
2693,Hey sween- I am in twin scroll (F10) land now and loving every moment of it.
2694,"Its been about 21 through the arctic weather we've had the past couple of months. Last tank improved to 22mpg with the slightly milder temps. This is all using the remote start ALOT, by the way. I'm guessing the warmer weather will see upwards of 23. Cruising all highway gets me about 26. So its pretty darned close to the mustang. Not surprising given their similar HP and not-so-dissimilar weight. (the extra 2 gears in the CTS is probably what offsets the extra 200 lbs and thirst of the extra torque.) I'm itching to get the summer tires back on there."
2695,"As this article says, it's very difficult these days to compete with the ""big 3"" of luxury: BMW, Lexus, and MB...."
2696,"I took my son's 2004 X3 2.5i(171k and going strong) to my dealer for an inspection and was given an X1 xDrive2.8i. This is the second time the dealer has given me an X1, and I really do like those little trucks. The steering and brake feel is spot on and the size is just about right- although it is a extremely porky at over 3800 lbs. 0-60 in 6 seconds is nothing to write home about, but adequate for its intended purpose. I could actually see owning an M Sport X1 xDrive 35i. While still no ball of fire(0-60 in 5.2 seconds) the truck would be a lot of fun for a second car or work hack."
2697,That would be a nice sled as well- especially if Alpina had their way with it...
2698,"I bet I know the answer, but I'll ask anyway.  Is that X3 available with a manual transmission?  Which diesel is it?"
2699,No MT (this is BMW we are talking about after all).  It is a 2.0L 4cyl Turbo Diesel.  180 hp - 280 lb ft torque.
2700,"RB....While I was having my issues with my previous Audi, I looked pretty closely at those X1s.  I thought in 35i guise, it was a nice little vehicle.  Very liveable with a little bit of spunk added to a daily hauler.  Plus, I think all loaded up, it came in at somewhere around the mid $40s, all shiny and new."
2701,I've driven an X1 as a loaner for a few days and really liked it.  I'd take it over a 320xi.
2702,"I had a similar conversation at my dealer when I got the ATS. Their response was almost identical. All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre."
2703,White is the new black.  According to our BMW store white is the most popular color.  Black and silver are also popular.
2704,Cadillac doesn't even offer a no-charge basic gloss white. The only white is a tricoat that is extra-cost. They do offer a no-charge basic gloss black. But some metallic paints are also no-charge. Go figure.
2705,The BMW optioning/pricing has always been a bit ridiculous- charging for HIDs? $3k for a locking diff? Both were standard on my MS3 in Grand Touring trim back in
2706,"What premium does M-B charge over ""basic"" for their expresso designo option, $4-6K?  Or is that reserved just for interior special orders?  (gulp)I've never had it on any of the five I've owned."
2707,"Back in the summer of 2010, my Mom factory ordered a 2011 V6 Cayenne.  When my Dad came to work the next day, I asked him about all the details (this was exciting.  First Porsche in the family).  I was a little confused when he told me they ordered the Cayenne in Sand White."
2708,One thing I like about the DHP on the X SAV's is they are more rear wheel bias when having fun and once slip is detected then more power goes to the front wheels. Not too sure if this is true on all X-Drive cars...
2709,"I like the blue on that one.  11K off?  wow.  Of course, that is also almost exactly the options load on that baby.  That seems nuts to me."
2710,"Mark our CA does well for himself in selling cars, he just delivered his 6th 750iL, that was speical ordered, in the color combo we want our GT, Midnight Blue with Oyster Interior, it's very stunning, but his GM wont pre-order one that color combo.."
2711,"Both are 2014 and been on the lots for well over 9 months, I think the GM made a mistake by not ordering the lighting package, I mean, $900 isn't going to break anyone's bank but really transforms the car with the angle eyes. IF it had the lighting back, I could take Rick into taking one of them, but as he say's, I'm spending 50K for a car, I want what I want.. Can't argue with that... I'm kinda surprised they haven't sold at least one of them. For the discount they are giving, someone can make money down the road..."
2712,"I don't have many complaints about BMW, but option cost tops the list.  Said it before, will again.  They're ""this close"" to pricing themselves right out of the ""it's not worth what I paid"" category.  Given no clear advantage for performance, quality, reliability, that's a dangerous place to be."
2713,"My sentiments exactly; I've owned 10 BMWs-from an E24 M6 to an E83 truck-over the past 32 years and I completely agree that upwards of 99% of the new Bimmers don't offer nearly enough performance to justify their premium price- particularly when you have to pay for ""options"" that come standard on many much less expensive cars(See: HIDs, enhanced Bluetooth and USB connectivity, decent ICE, EHP summer tires, heated seats, etc., etc.)."
2714,The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.
2715,How many of them are RWD and come with a manual transmission?
2716,"At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers.  Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with."
2717,"Mark, BMW builds the 3 series with a manual, IF people do not want all the bells and dodad's, you can order yourself a 328i w/ sport package, and manual, and be able to get about $36K if one does a European Delivery. Ora 320i w/ Sport Package and Manual, can be had for about 32K. Each are RWD and Manual."
2718,Don't forget to add the cost of the European vacation....
2719,"WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions.  Yeah, they are fun.  But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual.  Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price.  Yes, you can special order them.  But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one.  They're out there.  They're a acarcity, though."
2720,"Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual.  The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales?  They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature.  WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether.  See my next post."

2725,"This is true, but when you have over 3.9 million FF miles and a million hotel points, the cost is very low."
2726,"Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus.  I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+.  Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)"
2727,I did not mean to suggest or imply that I thought Audi had a 50/50 weight balanced RWD vehicle.  I was specifically responding to/about the availability of a BMW or an Audi (my S4 for instance) with a manual transmission. The original discussion/question posed mentioned RWD and manual transmissions. As far as I know there are still a few -- not many any more -- RWD and manual transmission cars that can be sourced from an ever shrinking number of manufacturers. Fewer still are the number of cars that can lay claim to having nearly or exactly 50/50 weight distribution with RWD and manual transmissions.
2728,"It's all good.  I totally get what you say.  Companies make what sells at prices they deem appropriate for return on their capital.  If just a few lunatics want what I want and they still are not willing to fork over the money, there is no point.  They make what will make them money, not what I, you, or three other people think they should make."
2729,"Where is it written that shift speed is the key factor?  What about shifting when you want, how you want, skipping as many gears as you want, and changing your mind in the middle of it all, if traffic or other conditions warrant?"
2730,"""They don't make music like THAT anymore, eh?"""
2731,"Well, to argue the other side, when talking about the good autos out there, they can do all of that. Its just as matter of pushing a button enough times. Drop down 3 gears? Click-click-click. Done. I drive with the Caddy in manual mode all the time, by the way. I prefer putting it in the correct gear before telling it what I want with the gas pedal."
2732,Exactly!
2733,Have you seen the pictures of the cockpits of the new mega class passenger jets?  There aren't any windows!
2734,I checked out leases on a q50 but the sport model like the $28k '13 G37s goes into $500/month and up.
2735,"The wide net they have cast allows them to sell more cars & SUVs.  At the same time, the brain trust in Munich is driving away it's core customers (or are we clients now?).  There was a time in my life when I had a major part of my automotive life mapped out in my head.  It was filled with 3s, 5s, X3s, M3s, X5s, and Z4s.  The current crop of 3ers are just normal cars to me.  They aren't super heroes anymore (except for the brakes, they are tremendous)."
2736,"Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$."
2737,"I didn't know you could option up a Mazda3 all the way to 30k. But I went to their site and you're right--it can be done. Since the Acura ILX starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an ILX for less than a fully tricked out 3. In terms of size, the two are very close. In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width."
2738,So BMW has announced Project XCite (wonder if it will come with Rimz and Tintz like the kids say these days):
2739,Mark....Are you a Miami alum?  I am.  Are you talking about WOXY?
2740,"Yes I am a Miami Alum, too and actually a Miami Merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from MU, worked at WOXR (not OXY) as the program director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week.  We WERE for about 6 years the only prog rock station in SW Ohio.  Those were the days. OXford Radio (OXR).  I have no idea why the name was changed to OXY."
2741,"Mark....I graduated in the early '80s from Miami (Computer Science).  Thought about grad school, but that's as far as I got.  I remember WMUB (university's station) and WOXY.  But remember listening to WOXR and WEBN growing up."
2742,WEBN = We Eliminate Banal Noise.
2743,Tree Frog Beer....Fools Day Parade....Jelly Pudding  Show.....King Biscuit Flour Hour.....great radio at the time.
2744,"Dino, our CA (Client Adviser) told me that 50% of the their  5, 6 and 7 series buyers order their cars, and less then a 1/3 of them do the ED. When it comes to the 3 and 4 series about 30% order their cars and over half of them do the ED. But that is a small # of 3 series buyers, you might be right that when it comes to the 3 series people want it now..."
2745,Now THAT is ironic.
2746,"When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships.  I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich.  I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom."
2747,"Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars.  My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer.  But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want."
2748,"I had exactly the same experience when I visited a BMW store in Scottsdale in 1999, back when BMWs were BMWs.  Haven't darkened the door of a BMW dealership since."
2749,"I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars.  As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles.  I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there.  At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger.  Rather than three engines, you get something like eight.  Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options.  Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books.  We enjoy lower price at expense of choices,  limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture.  They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege.  To each their own, I guess."
2750,"I was talking to our CA yesterday he was informing me that BMW has not released their ED allocation yet for the 2016 MY (something I already knew.) Chapman BMW has 2 2014 328i GT, both with M sport package, both equipped the same way."
2751,a $52K 3er without Xenon Headlights?  Hmmm.  How cheap are they willing to lease the car?
2752,"It's amazing how many black, white and silver Bimmers with black, occasional beige with light beige carpet interiors they have in stock, same with Audis.  To me, bland."
2753,I've mentioned that to my sales guy and he said he prefers more interesting colors as well- but bland colors are what the buyers want. Boring.
2754,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires."
2755,"Imagine if you had access to a great relatively lower cost Audi mechanic or two, that could have properly diagnosed the issues with your old A4 on the first attempt only replacing the parts that actually needed replacing!  I have access to such a mechanic and it's part of the reason I love Audi so much.   Incompetent, or worse, dishonest mechanics can end up costing you a lot of money."
2756,markcincinnati- Mmy opinions pretty much align with
2757,"As you say, by the time you fully trick out an A3 2.0 it's c. $42k. It's no doubt better than an ILX premium in many ways, but then again it should be at that price. For $42k msrp you can get an Acura TLX 3.5 V-6 with SH-AWD and the Advance Package, which has some features not found on the A3, plus quite a bit more room for passengers and cargo. Not everybody wants to pay $10-$15k more for a comparable ca, but Audis are no doubt great cars these days—in looks, performance, design, and features...."
2758,"I think a 2.0 A3 can be had for about $33-34K, and that's with Quattro AWD standard.  Why must one ""trick out"" a vehicle?"
2759,"Just received my latest issue of C & D, brief test of the new Jag XE.  Skimmed the article, sounds like those that pine for the 3 series of old may want to check out the XE!  Not a lightweight, but per the review, drives like one.  With steering/road feel!"
2760,"I don't know how it happened, but my wife's interest in cars these days seems to focus on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whistles (but she thinks cruise control is the devil's own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile Ultra High Performance All-Seasons)."
2761,"This is simple, because we can. Some of the new tech stuff is cool, what is really nice is cars today are rolling computers in which one could code a car to have these new techie stuff without paying for them. The downside is, when you take your car into the dealer they will update your firmware if an update is out. How to side step this is, to tell your service managers NOT to update the firmware."
2762,"Jag needs to prove themselves, being a viable BMW alternative. So will Jag be giving away the XE for the first 6 months or so or will they play by the rules and gouge people on the leases? Time will tell."
2763,I read that as well; Jaguar is joining Cadillac and Lexus in taking over some of the turf  BMW has abandoned. I'll definitely give the XE a look.
2764,Exactly. I remember driving a pre-production E36 325i; I wanted one
2765,"I'm lost on  ""find a way to get this car, NOW!""."
2766,"Mark, why didn't your wife choose the Q5 TDI? better MPG and more torque then the SQ5, and a lower price point too. If I was going to get a SUV, it would be either the Q5 or X5d. Hard to bed 400lbs of torque and mid 30's MPG..."
2767,"Honestly the ILX isn't that appealing to me, and the TLX when I sat in it is surprisingly similar to my current car which still is really nice. So I'm holding out a bit more. Believe it or not, I'm thinking of possibly a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan as a poor man's BMW at a much lower price. I rented a 328 recently (I'm sure it was a stripper model) and I wasn't very impressed."
2768,Maybe I should join the BMW CCA and find out what this BMW enthusiasm is all about...
2769,??
2770,The SQ5 with the supercharged V6 is much quicker and the S treatment just can't be replicated from the option list.
2771,The least expensive A3 2.0 at my local dealer has a list of $38 k:
2772,Acura still makes cars....
2773,"I drove ""bare bones"" 328i multiple times, as loaners, each time it was for a couple of days (they always kept my car for service overnight), so I got about a week's worth of standard F30 328.  Still don't care for the steering.  Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension.  Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon.  It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it?  Two reasons - fuel and market demand.  The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units.  The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.  Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs"
2774,"Acura has been weak when it comes to cars. But maybe, just maybe, they are coming back?"
2775,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either."
2776,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo."
2777,Mark....bravo.
2778,"I generally agree with you, Mark.  I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements.  There is no deal, if one gets not what they want.  I also totally understand BMW's move.  Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh"
2779,"OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions.  For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now."
2780,"I was joking with the ""impolite"" comment.  I guess the wink wasn't enough to convey the message...  I can be a lunatic, why not.  Will wear it as a badge of honor."
2781,"BTW, I disagree with all this mess being MY fault.  Don't look at me, I did my part - all my cars, but one had manual transmission. I got a manual, I got sport suspension, I insisted on a factory order with everything I wanted, not the sales manager thought I wanted. So I did my part, yet they still changed that because others didn't. In other word, IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE at fault, namely all other self-described ""enthusiasts"", who couldn't wait six weeks for their car, or had thousand other excuses (my wife won't let me), so they took what was on the lot.  So yeah, I will [non-permissible content removed] a little..."
2782,"I know you were and it did, dino001 -- we're having a snow day here at the office, so I'm pretty much alone, no emails, no phone calls, just white death out my window.  I could hardly be in a better mood and in no way didn't get the ""wink""."
2783,"I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard."
2784,"It's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. You aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful V6"" in their ""Beamer"" at the Performance Center or at a CCA HPDE."
2785,"I have to admit that Audis and BMWs are beautiful cars, at least to me. They call out to me in a way few other cars do. MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:"
2786,"roadburner:  You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that."
2787,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer.  Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:"
2788,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys."
2789,"My track days are over.  But, I still like a good handling car.  I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are.  There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago).  Just not so much any more."
2790,Business is good in Mark land.
2791,I have to say that I really
2792,roadburner: Amen.
2793,"RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else.  I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen."
2794,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW.  I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!"""
2795,Are you referring to
2796,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term)."
2797,"I think a big part of what BMW has lost is that it has cast such a ""large net.""  The current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did.  3 years ago I made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 Acura TSX for a leftover 2011 BMW 328xi.  I drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years.  Fast forward to today.  If I still had my Acura (yes I'm a card carrying member of Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous) and said to myself just as I did 3 years ago:  ""You know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, I've always wanted a 3er, so let me take a test drive...""  I would have left the dealership with a cold feeling.  175 hp 4cyl engine is ok for me in my $25K Legacy, but 140 hp turbo 4 cyl wouldn't cut the mustard in a $40K BMW 320xi."
2798,"Hard for even me to believe, but on the strength of SUVs Acura slightly outsold Cadillac and Audi for Feb:"
2799,I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.
2800,Luxury market for Feb:
2801,"As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention"
2802,"I had a '98 Audi A4 and loved that car - V6 with a 5 speed manual. It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles. It was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4. I really still do miss that Audi. But I really do like the reliability of my Acura."
2803,"Dude, you got to drive a 320xd? The only one imported into the US..."

2806,"Sorry.  What is it, a 328xd?  My brain was semi fried from last night's 2 hour & 23 minute commute home (32 miles)."
2807,"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the Acura banner.  It's up to you now."
2808,"The S4 has been guzzling gas in the city/freeway traffic I drive in lately.  I take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and I can see less than 20 MPG with my lead foot in the S4.  I'm not happy about that, but I know it is possible to get 30 MPG in the thing if you maintain a constant high velocity over large distances, and I'm very happy about that."
2809,"I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition.  Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot.  In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight."
2810,Aside from the NSX I never gave Acura the slightest bit of consideration; when I'm spending $35k or more FWD cars and FWD biased AWD cars simply aren't on my radar.
2811,"I haven't driven a GS, but to say it's a more engaging drive than an F30 328i is kind of damning with faint praise..."
2812,Is the Buick FWD?
2813,Yes the Regal they recommend is FWD.  You can get it with AWD and stick if you want.
2814,I think AWD is only available with the slushbox.
2815,I love the anti acura stuff
2816,Best car for money
2817,"I did notice a better feel from the S4's 60/40 RWD emphasis with the AWD system, that does make it feel better and more RWD-like.  On the TL-SH-AWD it felt FWD and when you gassed it, you could feel, AND see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front."
2818,I would say the best reason to get rid of the TL was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.
2819,Consumer Reports said it best about the TL.  Looks like it got it with the big ugly stick
2820,"Sweenydog, I am going to price out the lease on the Q next week.  I'd have to add the mileage hit up front since the cheap lease is for 10K miles/yr and I drive 15K."
2821,"I get people not liking the styling of the TL.  Personally, I did like it.  I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine."
2822,Count me in as a TL-SH AWD fan.  I like the pre & post face lifted versions too.
2823,"Me too- gone but not forgotten TL SH (diamond white pearl), six trouble free years."
2824,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance.  I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody.  The air conditioned seats were great.  The power was good, nothing to scare an S4.  The brakes were very weak.  The doors sounded tinny when closed.  It was a beer to the Audi's champagne.  Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4."
2825,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months."
2826,"Mark, when it comes to cars, for me, my all time favorite care was my Alfa GT-V6, it was a poor mans Ferrari..  Talk about soul!!"
2827,"Nice! I'm a bit of an Alfa guy and that is one I've always admired, but I was too late to the party and finding a nice one is damned near impossible. I've run across a couple in the past decade, but never at a time I could do anything about it."
2828,"Have you ever been to Munich? If not, I can offer up a couple of restaurant recommendations that are equal to or better than restaurants in New York, Paris, London, Prague and Warsaw.  If you're going to stay in country for more than a few days, I can also suggest a couple of relatively close destinations that are breathtakingly beautiful."
2829,"Good GT=V6's are out there just got to pay for them, just like the NSX's..."
2830,Mark I'll take you up on that offer and the Neuschwanstein Castle is mandatory when during a BMW ED..
2831,"The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points...."
2832,"Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
2833,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong."
2834,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
2835,Of that I am certain.
2836,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars.  I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next."
2837,"Enthusiasts used to buy BMWs because they were great cars. Now many new buyers select a BMWs so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown I met at my dealer's F30 intro; he informed me that  ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."""
2838,"While I do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, I perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . ."""
2839,"When you have a product that isn't selling you tend to have a fire sale. People say that Acura has a problem, look at Infiniti, the QX60 is a rebadged Pathfinder, the QX70 hasn't changed in 6 years, theQX50 (EX) again nothing new there... The Q70 stale..."
2840,"Exactly. They can't sell a lot of what they have in the lineup right now. Odd styling, and not much cachet left with the brand. They just fired their US chief within the last week or two. Infiniti needs to turn it around, fast."
2841,"The VQ engine is a masterpiece, however, it is a thirsty engine, hopefully Nissan will be able to turn the Infiniti brand around, and they really need to do it quickly..."
2842,Are they really able to sell Q50's for $50K?  Fully loaded with all the bells and whistles???
2843,Nissan/Infinity needs to fire their stylists; all of their cars(save the 370Z and GT-R) look like they melted in the sun and the SUVs are pretty horrible as well.
2844,Exactly. Some loyalty and conquest cash goes a long way.
2845,"well, the answer to the ""can Infiniti sell them for 50k?"" must be No, if they are subsidizing the leases that much!"
2846,"In November, current lessees were given an extra $2500 incentive to lease..   that generates a lot of repeat sales..    Our 2011 G37X had an MSRP of $42K and a lease payment of $351/mo.+tax..      That's hard to beat."
2847,Why talk about lease prices and not the actual selling price?
2848,I have to assume the Q50 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.
2849,"I'm still interested in a '13 G37S sedan @ $28,200 with 20K miles."
2850,I still love my Q50 Hybrid but they aren't selling well for sure.
2851,I see lots of big discounts on the infinities. I would say the average transaction price is in the low 40s
2852,"This is pretty sad for a car company that once was nipping at the heals of BMW, Carlos Ghosn has his work cut out for him.."
2853,"Yes.. I am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price.  So cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years."
2854,It's too bad that Infiniti has had troubles in the sales arena.  They used to make some fairly appealing sport-luxury vehicles.  Now?  Not so much.
2855,A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.
2856,"I think Acura still have problems, their two best sellers are the MDX and RDX, the MDX is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the RDX just got another refresh..  I liked Acura better when they had the Legend and Integra."
2857,"the MDX was just fully redesigned for 2015 (or was it 2014?).  How did that get long in the tooth already?  Plus I thought it was selling quite well.  The RDX came out for 2013, so this is the normal time for it's mid-cycle refresh."
2858,"No disagreements with you or Mark.  Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither."
2859,I saw some promo pricing on the TLX advertised on the weekend. First time I have seen them with trunk money.
2860,"We drove a MDX and Jeep GC the same day, I liked the ride in the Jeep over the MDX, talk about uninspiring to drive, and the MDX is their best seller...  Your right the RDX was new in 2013, but the refresh will make it more competitive then the MDX.."
2861,Acura sold 2900 TLX's in January compared to 1400 TL's and 900 TSX's in January 2014 - so about a 25% jump compared to the old models it replaces.
2862,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things.  The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies."
2863,"I remember late '90s/early '00s, I thought of Acura as an aspirational brand, out of my price range at the time but something I might consider later on when I could afford one. Now they are not on my radar nor are they in any way appealing."
2864,"I just saw a blurb last night that I think came from CR.  Now, aside from appliances and lawn mowers, for which I seek out their ratings, for cars I don't use them all that much."
2865,I could never drive an IS AWD with that giant hump where my ankle gives. I can't believe anyone will buy one with that.  Absolute deal breaker for me!
2866,"I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars.  It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor."
2867,My experience with my modded 135i has also soured me on reprogramming.
2868,Got the performance package from my BMW dealer on my 335 coupe.  Bumped HP and Torque about 10%.  Dealer did it.  No problems.  All under BMW warranty.
2869,"I installed a Dinan chip in my M6 and a Turner/Conforti chip in my Club Sport. I installed the Hypertech flash/tune in my Mazdaspeed 3(netting me an extra 50 lb-ft of torque over a wide spread of the powerband. The Club Sport now has 140k on it- no issues, even though it sees the track at least once a year. The MS3 149k on the clock with no issues as well."
2870,I need a new ride since my daughter turns 17 and we play musical cars.  I looked at a '13 G37S sedan (RB-Approved Right Wheel Drive and 6MT).  It has 20.2K miles for $28.2K.  Still has 2 years on the BtoB warranty.
2871,I've looked at the Sport model more than once. They are
2872,burger is what i used on my 135i. Was the tune responsible for the problems? I don't know for sure. Could be the car would have had all its problems anyway. I can tell you the car would go into limp mode far far easier when the tune was turned on.
2873,"Thanks, RB."
2874,"You are the only person I have heard who had this problem, so far I have not had this problem or others on bimmerfest.."
2875,"It's not going to happen until March 20-22 as that's the weekend there's a track event and the shop sponsor to the club will be at the track event again.  They are located far from me in Bakersfield, CA; so meeting up at the track weekend to do the tune works best.  Since I won a huge discount, I'm going with them and REVO.  I'll let you know how it passes the butt dyno test.  I think it normally costs $1,100."
2876,"I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars.  It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor."
2877,"I remember coming across a couple of others reporting limp issues with the tune, but then they'd get quickly ganged up on and disappear. I did not see anybody else going through sensors like mine was, though. The reliability issues are why I did not have that car very long."
2878,Interesting.....
2879,"My wife's work sled was drafted for snowplow duty today(along with my MS3). Every 2-3 hours I drove one or the other up or down my 1500' driveway to keep the snow knocked down. The Bridgestone Blizzak LM-25 tires worked a treat, as the Brits would say; on the first run a few drifts were higher than the fog lamps."
2880,seems like that would have been natural duty for the Wrangler.  Guess you wanted to do it in comfort.
2881,"The Wrangler went out first because I wanted to make sure that there were no trees down or other problems. The MS3 was the real snow excavator, it was the least competent due to the lower rid height and the fact that it is running UHP all season tires- the Wrangler and 3er both sport winter rubber."
2882,"CTS4 did great.  Standard All Seasons did a good job.  Other folks on the road, especially in SUVs?  Some, not so good.  Saw a few off the side of the road."
2883,"Yeah...I see where you're coming from.  But, there are some here at Edmunds who have gone out and bought one for the same reasons they list."
2884,"Well, why I usually am left confused by such a list is the breakout of the categories. So the Charger is a sport sedan? Really? Not quite the classification I would give it. On top of that, why are Luxo Sedans mutually exclusive from Sport Sedans? And same goes with Family Sedan. So the Charger isn't a Family Sedan?? Its just all so convoluted so they can list whatever they want. They decide they want to mention a particular car, so they make up yet another category for it. Note the 3 choices for Best Dream Machine. Why can't there be 1 winner there? And why were they too lazy in that instance to not make up 3 separate categories for them? ""Best Dream Machine AWD Coupe-like Sedan,"" ""Best Hybrid German Coupe Over $100k,"" and ""Best Italian Hybrid Supercar."" There ya go."
2885,I'm jealous you guys in the snow get to have fun like this guy:
2886,What a DB.  Former BMW driver I guess.
2887,"No snow fun here. The storm was Sunday - started out with about 8-10"" of snow, then changed to rain for an hour or so, then about 2 hours of freezing rain with a flash freeze as temps plummeted. The result of it all was that everything had 1""-2"" of ice on pavement/sidewalks under the snow crust. I didn't even try to drive anywhere until today after 2 days of clearing efforts around the house. The roads here are atrocious. Even main routes aren't all down to bare pavement since there is caked ice stuck to the pavement in areas that is really hazardous. Side streets are still mostly all ice since it has been too cold for road salt to do much. Add to that all the snowbanks from previous storms making roads narrow, with many merge lanes on expressways simply not there. I'm not going anywhere over the next few days because it is still too risky."
2888,"Annual Father/Son ski trip to Sunday River in Maine this week.  Left a day earlier than planned as predictions of blizzard conditions Sunday morning.  So, drove through some blizzard conditions Saturday night!  The XF was a rock star, AWD/All Seasons tracked steady and true.  Stopped for dinner in York, pulled up restaurants on the Nav, told son to pick one.  I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently.  So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF!  Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs...  One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car!  But, light and fluffy."
2889,"Just saw my first F Type Jag, it was the sport model R type, nice sounding exhuast tone"
2890,I run '18 winter spt dunlops - they have done the job thus far in the great white north east. Amazing how much snow = 90 inches in a month. The car kills it in light snow and is fun to get a little sideways. Im afraid to hit the gas when the snow gets deeper or at night. The video above I have seen before highlights Quattro but also brute force of a beast tuned car - if you had a 500 hp subi it would do the same in similar snow. The car being lower then a normal a4 I'm afraid to push it as those foglights can be expensive to replace
2891,Check out the new Road and Track for an unabashed love letter to the new Audi S3.
2892,"What's with the Q50?  people over on the ""prices paid"" and ""lease questions"" boards seem to be getting them at substantial discounts (not like"
2893,Hmmmmm....maybe Infiniti is throwing some support money at their leases?
2894,"As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4."
2895,"I have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice.  Most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the Honda, VW and Ford dealerships.  I go in with a good attitude.  If there is a problem with the service work, they know I will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey.  I try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue."
2896,Good thinking lol! Hadn't thought of that. Might try that someday....
2897,"Assuming my comments are not banned:  We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati.  I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection."
2898,"Acura- this page and others on edmunds seemed to always be - let's see how good this new acura is- and the Tsx is a comp to others- and the TL is an poor mans s4. but acura for the last 15? Years has not done anything in sedan form. If you want a great Acura sedan (or coupe) get the second gen type2 legend -(6 speed please, google it)  (the square TL /s another) and also the bug eyed integra GS-r.  The last TL, the last Tsx and the first ILX - no good -(all ugly and could not match comp)  the RLX no one buys. The new TLX from reports is nice but nothing special- You can look at zero to sixty numbers and cost of new ILX (for 16) vs its comp but is it really in this class? It's still a civic under the skin and until Acura runs a turbo 4 it's a back burner car at best - Infiniti after gaining so much traction is now nowhere as well- maybe the parents don't care -"
2899,"It happens I'm 50, not that you would have known, and so it's not like I need to google that 6-speed Legend. I admired it back in the day."
2900,"Dealership is the front line of your ownership experience.  As the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression""."
2901,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership.  I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep.  Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont).   We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference).  I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again.  The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership.  I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that."
2902,"That's just about the same policy I follow. My SA at my BMW dealer is also a CCA member and attends HPDEs in his 1998 M3. I've also built a relationship with one SA at my Mazda dealer. I've also written letters of praise to the corporate offices; in 1996 I even received a personal reply from Vic Doolan, who at that time was the President of BMWNA. It's amazing to see what happens when you are courteous and don't treat the dealer as an adversary..."
2903,"And as I noted, I don't burn them on surveys.  If I have a problem, I speak with them directly.  A couple of years ago I had the timing belt done on my Passat.  About 30 days later, the thermostat went.  It requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt.  I mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer history.  He noted how much I've spent there, if I was asked if I wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and I'm sure somewhere in there is my CSI report.  Viola - 3 hour labor credit."
2904,Exactly. The surveys are ridiculous to begin with- anything less than a top mark being considered a failure.
2905,Finally alive again - nice work men. My anger with Acura (don't get me going on Infiniti) is they were so close and they blew it. They had the turbo and shelved it. They had cool names and ofcourse the reliability.  The ILX is basically a TSX gen one reborn - - which is a good thing but the true comp has them beat. I don't have the numbers but my audi dealer has 60 a3s on the lot and 3 of them are the 1.8. Read caranddriver.com for there take and it's not a good read for the ILX. Weight 63% front should be fun on the twists go.
2906,"If you recently bought a new car and are really appreciating high-tech features you didn't have previously, a reporter wants to hear from you. Please email PR@edmunds.com by Thursday, February 12, 2015 and include your daytime contact information and a few words about your experience."
2907,"I remember talking about the CTS and how I liked it and you mentioned that you wouldn't step in a Caddy dealer because of how they treated your mother many years prior, but giving you 15K off MSRP changed that for you.... Now if the dealer came back with only 7% off MSRP would you have taken the dealer?   But in the end, money talks and did for you... I'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15K off a 60K car I'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your TL was. Dealer experience goes only so far, it's nice to go to my BMW dealer and help myself to the coffee bar and pastries, but I'd rather not have to go to the dealership at all."
2908,"my Acura dealer is perfectly nice.  nothing over the top fancy.  But, breakfast stuff (donuts), little water bottles, a TV, and a small business area if you want a desk or PC..  Good enough for me, since I go there every 6-7 months when the little wrench comes on, and just drive into the express lane (no appointment) and am done in an hour or less.  maybe slightly longer if I was do for extra stuff."
2909,"According to this article, Acura may be bringing back the Type S designation in the form of a turbo 4 cyl producing 300+ hp.  I think that would make the ILX, which it is apparently slated for, more than competitive."
2910,that could make an interesting little buggy.
2911,"Only if they add SH-AWD, then you'd have a Golf R or Focus RS competitor."
2912,Sween....you and I agree (O.M.G.....
2913,"Well I am a big guy and this 535 fits me perfectly- this thing is a blast in the snow, the TL AWD is good but the Bimmer is GREAT."
2914,"LOL @ $300 oil changes.   I won't be getting my Audi serviced at the dealership again; it's just too much of a rip off.   For your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change.   I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!).  They are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems."
2915,"At my last HPDE event I won an auction to get more than half off on a Audi S4 3.0 Supercharge tune that takes the S4 to 400+ HP.  They couldn't make the tune happen on a Sunday, so it'll happen at my next HPDE event in March.  This is a tune that turns the S4 into a M3 killer.  Since my car has been pretty much flawless, I think I will go ahead and risk the potential ""warranty"" issues.   It's already a beast; should be fun."
2916,"I took my Club Sport to my BMW dealer last month for an Oil Service, brake fluid flush, and coolant change and I was only charged $315."
2917,"RB.....my BMW dealer keeps sending me ""Service Specials"" in the mail, even though I no longer own a BMW.  They tout that their prices are in line with other national car service places.  They say they'll meet or beat any other store on tire prices.  And, they're charging $70 for a synthetic oil change, tire rotation and whatever inspections BMW requires."
2918,"I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5,  S6 and S7, for instance.  Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic.  The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine.  The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.)."
2919,M
2920,I guess they figure a lot of Audi owners are made of money and won't shop around.
2921,"I'm not worried about it.  When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one.  Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless.  Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque.  I'm not too worried about it.  I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."
2922,I like the S3. Sharp looking but small.  The 19' performance pck/ tires look awesome on this vehicle.  Wondering what the mpg's are on the 2.0 turbo???
2923,"Had a chance to drive an S3 while I was in Indianapolis about a week ago.  I usually don't do test drives unless I'm at least contemplating a car, which I'm not.  But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer.  Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s.  Dealer plate on and away we went."
2924,Can you get it with a stick?
2925,"You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option.  If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically.  I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value.  From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico."
2926,"I need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" Quattro AWD system in your S4?  How did you notice it?  Did it happen every time? occasionally?  Did it worsen over time?"
2927,"kyfdx...no stick on the S3 (at least that's what the sales person said).  The MSRP on the one I drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50K door, but you could still add more to it."
2928,"I don't think you can get a stick in a Golf R, either..."
2929,"That goes for the all-new 2015 Golf R with 292 HP (just like the S3).  If you want a stick, you gotta get the 4-door hatch."
2930,"I recall Audi used to sell 4-year maintenance package for around $500 (A4 price).  With $300 right out of the gate, this would have been a bargain.   It was even more attractive with lease as it increased the residual by couple of percent, too.  Do they still do that, or did their prices increased?"
2931,"The price is around $850 for 3 years...   On a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400..    Which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance."
2932,I have always run winter tires on my wife's BMW. She's had two 3ers and one 5er and we've nevr had any trouble. I run a UHP all season tire on my MS3(currently the Cooper Zeon RS3-A). The only issue is our 1500' gravel driveway- if the snow gets too deep we have to resort to Jeep Mode...
2933,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category.  The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too.  A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying."
2934,"The 2016,  S6  gets  some minor refreshers/ updates  and 30 more horse pw to 450.  This vehicle is on my short list  also"
2935,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster...."
2936,Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:
2937,Couple of things - first s3 thought some of you would like this mashup
2938,The M235i is the
2939,"Ben, thanks for that.  I saw the piece in MT I think.  See, this now sounds like the car I should have waited for.  Exactly what my wish list it pretty much.  I really liked the interior and size.  Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed.  and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal."
2940,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX.  Wife tried one before settling on the Accord.  Tough sell.  Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord.  Hard to make that fly."
2941,"The dealership experience makes all of the difference, doesn’t it?  When I was younger, I could not understand why anyone would pay the money for a new Cadillac.  Then I owned my first Cadillac (not new, but new enough to be under factory warranty).  After that, I truly did understand."
2942,"Exactly, my wife is extremely reluctant to buy anything other than a CPO BMW because of the great treatment we receive from both the sales and service departments."
2943,VW dealerships don't have a stellar reputation.  My experience with Audi dealers has been perfectly fine.  They should definitely work at dropping the bad apples.
2944,Now I've had a great relationship with my VW dealer and service department.
2945,"I can highly recommend West Houston Volkswagen.  Their service department treats you so well, you will swear it's a Cadillac dealership.  Archer Volkswagen (also here in Houston), well, you will swear you're at the Ford dealership service department (which is NOT a good thing!)."
2946,"Dealer experience seems entirely local and hence quite variable. Last night on the news I saw a report of a Mini owner whose car had a bad engine just out of warranty and who had a very bad experience with her dealer and BMW Canada corporate. The local BMW/Mini dealer (not the one in the TV report) had a very bad rep for customer service but has recently been sold to one of the two local dealer groups, the same one I bought my ATS from, who probably will be better. The former owner's rep couldn't be much worse than what it was."
2947,"Dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand.  I've been born beat even by Mercedes dealerships, and I've been treated like gold at Chevy dealerships.  At the Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes dealerships, you expect better, though.  You expect the sales and service reps to listen and respond to what you want or need.  Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car."
2948,"If you can get a tune that keeps the warranty I wonder why it wasn't standard in the first place.  I bet gas mileage will drop in exchange for that 90 lb-ft.  Sell a gimped but still quick car with decent mileage, report decent mileage to the government for CAFE purposes, then sell a cheap ECU flash that un-gimps the engine..."
2949,My mildly tuned MS3 develops an average of 50 lb-ft of torque over the stock engine from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and fuel economy actually improved a bit- when I can resist the urge to stay out of boost...
2950,"So, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation. (that is, of course, for cars with a good reputation)"
2951,"My tune on my BMW has not affected my MPG at all, I'm still averaging 30."
2952,Getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:
2953,"Yeah, I have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. The only time I would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it."
2954,Mark:
2955,"I want to, I plan to, when I can afford it. Unfortunately, I never did take my mustang to the track while I owned it. We took a big vacation last summer instead, so I didn't feel comfortable burning the money on a track trip. Who knows what this year will bring?"
2956,My modifications to the MS3 have been ridiculously cheap. I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97.
2957,"To me, this vacation sounds like a much better use of money.  More than just you can enjoy a vacation.  So, kudos to you for this.  Unless you have money to burn (which I never have had), track stuff seems pretty selfish to me.  There is not much in life I enjoy more than a good vacation.  YMMV, as always."
2958,10.1 and 3:06.8 with my Vsport.
2959,Thank heavens my wife doesn't begrudge me a few track weekends  per year. They relax me more than a vacation- but we take one or two of those as well...
2960,"I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that.  The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads.   I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too).  I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power.  Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers,  in frozen weather for the NE USA.  Not for warm Southern CA tracks.  Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's."
2961,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
2962,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right?  If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs.   The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary."
2963,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference."
2964,Here is a small article on the new
2965,"FN...just saw that article last night.  Jags have never been on my radar, but that one looks interesting. It will be a while before it gets here, but will at least do a test drive."
2966,Sounds hopeful!
2967,"GG as I posted by the time it arrives all the other sport sedan will have fixed their short comings to a point, so Jag better have it's game on..."
2968,"Acura's ILX, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. But the new ILX is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger TLX. The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."
2969,"Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass.  I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time.  Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with  the pack)."
2970,"GG, for 2016 the 3 series enters it's Mid Life cycle and gets updated, with new engines ""B"" series engines which are to make more power and be more efficient, better steering and upgrade interior.  I hope the new Jag is a home run which makes everybody else do better."
2971,"Yes, Acura has gone backwards in almost every category of measurement with the TLX from the TL."
2972,"I'm torn:  I want to see Jag thrive, but (at least around here) I love not seeing one on every street corner a la 3, C and A4.  Or in my case, 5, E and A6.  The XF is probably more car/bigger than I need, so I'm intrigued by the XE.  Although, I was hoping for styling other than MinimeXF."
2973,"LD....I think I mentioned that my best friend bought a new Sting Rey convertible.  Just an incredible car.  His will be a Queen Bee, though.  He'll only take it out when it's sunny and warm enough to put the top down.  No track.  No long trips."
2974,A friend of mine just bought a new Stingray with
2975,RB....my friend went in the opposite direction with his Vette.  He got a 1LT (lowest package with Z51 pack and Magnetic Ride Contro.  No automatic.  No Nav.  Pretty much a stripped version (or more stripped than you usually find them).
2976,"A friend of mine has a new Z06..     My son got to drive it, which sort of ticks me off..."
2977,"The S3 is a pretty solid package if you can live with a dual clutch gearbox and the small sedan which leads to well, a small car with a small trunk."
2978,"Wow the coverage on caddy is unreal- good for the customers who are going that way. Cool looking cars- good to see reliability has come back but as others state above- I'm a car guy and I have not driven a caddy in my life- I'm mid thirties - in fact I have not been in one or a Lincoln in 10 years (not including biz trips to and from the airport runs). I'm trying to put a finger on why I have not driven/looked at one- recall concerns seem like a cop out, no one I know owns them-"
2979,"Should my lottery numbers ever hit or I get a large inheritance from a rich relative I don't know, I'm very interested in the ATS Coupe. I think it looks better than the 2- or 4-series coupe from BMW or the A5. Have heard many good things about the 272 HP 2.0L turbo engine."
2980,"*""I know of three folks in these forums who have purchased / leased Cadillacs this year. 1 ATS and 2 CTS (one a V-Sport).""*"
2981,That's true but very often one person will remark about their uncle's co-worker's sister that had a flat tire on her 1972 Deville and many accept that as proof that Cadillac must still make bad cars.
2982,"Plus the way these guys flip, 2 of them may be gone by the time 2016 rolls around."
2983,Indeed.
2984,did we lost the ability to completely delete posts? i'm typing this only because it won't let me delete what I had before. ugh.
2985,"well, at least now the CTS and S70 are both sedans."
2986,"I've had my S4 for about a year now (more if you include down-time due to accident), and I haven't had any problems with it.  Looks like you took out all the problems with your S4, and everyone else is benefitting!"
2987,"I'm now at 22,000 miles on my '14 S4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless.  Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal.""  The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile.  However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless).  Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers."
2988,"speaking of infotainment systems, I don't understand all the media hate of CUE. I prefer it to the system in my wife's Chrysler. I find it easier to navigate and certainly offers more features. Hell, at least Siri works with it, which is more than I can say for the Chrysler. Anyway, I like CUE. Just putting that out there."
2989,"I concur.  Matter of fact, I consider it the best piece of automotive GPS/Voice/Touch control on the market.  And, I've used Audi's MMI, BMW's iDrive and Acura Link.  Even the ""MyCadillac/OnStar"" app is great.  I can remotely start th ecar, see current MPG on the current tankful, find where I parked my car, lock/unlock the car, download addresses from the internet to the car's GPS, etc."
2990,I'm at 24K miles with the 320.
2991,"I dragged myself to a Caddy dealer to drive one for the first time before easily deciding to get the (ordered from Germany in August 2013) S4 for more bang for my buck.  I drove the ATS 2.0T and 3.6.  The high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike.  A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel.  I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?"
2992,"When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty?  That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70.   I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB."
2993,Reliable and Durable:
2994,My Club Sport track rat has over 140k on it with no major repairs; ditto for my 148k MS3. My son's X3 has nearly 170k on it with one major repair- but since I haven't had a car payment since 2006 I think I'm still ahead of the game.
2995,"Mark....well said.  I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history."
2996,"on the flip side GG, the thought of keeping these modern hi-tech marvels for a long time/lot of miles is scary.  My 2000 TL went 175K for me, but that car was a relative ox-cart compared to yours.  The only worry I had was the tranny crapping out, and that was still simple even if it would cost around 3K!  The rest of the fancy stuff was basic (bun warmers, BOSE radio, normal power options).  I changed out the suspension front and rear on sale at Sears for about $600."
2997,"Huh. But you were looking at Challengers, right? I'm surprised considering the cars you seem to love are pretty lightweight. You checked out the Toyobaru, right? I would imagine the power is a letdown, though. What else have you tried out? New Stang, perhaps?"
2998,"Stick...all good points.  I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term.  I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc.  Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware."
2999,"I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't."
3000,Eco boost stang getting good press and looks like its easy to toon.
3001,Sweet!
3002,You will soon be able to get a tune from Ford Racing that provides a healthy power bump yet preserves the factory warranty. The FRPP tune for the Focus ST boosts midrange torque by 90 lb-ft.
3003,If it's around 2k I would really consider this if I had the Eco stang. Lighter then gt - good fuel Eco and close figures on paper
3004,"Wow! That's variety.  My question is this:  would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US?  And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US.  My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the  range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice."
3005,"As I noted in another topic, in 2007 I wrote an article on the international launch of the E93. I noted that BMW would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt. The latest BMWs aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""The Ultimate Fashion Accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
3006,"I actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for.  Simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper.  More of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335.  The volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right?"
3007,"I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate."
3008,Sorry FN....just saw your question.  Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.
3009,Graph- Can I ask? Why did you get rid of your TL?
3010,RB...you're a track guy.  I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).
3011,"No question, happened to me on the '06 330xi I leased.  Made the station pay for a new rim!"
3012,Billy...I really had no good reason to explain why I got rid of the TL SH AWD.  Great cars....all the TL's I've had.
3013,"Sween...paid $38 and change for the TL.  Caddy dealer gave $32.  Figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33."
3014,"circle....good points.  I think Cadillac is going through a transition.  Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW.  My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus.  Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two.  What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6."
3015,"Graphic, question for you.  What are you getting for gas mileage?  I realize that this is a minor issue currently while gas/oil prices are at a several year low.  To me, in 2015 (well just about), along with style and other features, I just can't hang my hat on cars getting 18-22 mpg unless they're high performance or ultra-luxury vehicles.  Like the new Caddy's though except the SRX doesn't do anything for me."
3016,"carnaught.....still in break in.  Only 4 fillups so far.  1st tank-19MPG.  2nd tank-21MPG...all city.  3rd tank was 24MPG, about 50-50 city/highway."
3017,'13 Advance....20K miles.
3018,"Ok well I officially call this deal the best of all time'- infact in my region within 250miles there are 6 TLs  that are priced higher then your trade in price, all are 2014s with the exception of one 13 that has half the miles you traveled. Add in the ridiculous deal you got on the cts and it adds up to a nice kia."
3019,Thank you Sween.  Motivated dealer who wanted to right a wrong and move into the customer service top tier was the key to the deal.
3020,"Redic motivated - I hope the cts adds up to a good car for you. 100x better looking then the tL, as we can now agree was an amazingly ugly/ not so much in post surgery - but the early 08/11 wow Really bad. If you can get 6k off the CtS in 2 years please give me a call before you do it- need to see the approach"
3021,"Losing $6K depreciation on the CTS probably isn't in the cards.  But, I bought it right.  So, it will all even out."
3022,Here is an article by
3023,I think the reason people aren't buying Caddys is that their traditional demo is dying off and the younger set is seeing the taint of decades of GM mediocrity and reliability issues.
3024,And the new head of Cadillac has the very odd view that fewer sales are somehow better.....???
3025,...and I believe that the younger set aren't seeing the taint of their grandpa's Caddy whereas they don't want to drive their father's Mercedes.
3026,I used to tell my sales staff that high sales volume at low margins does not mean they're good at their jobs.  High margins coupled with high volumes were the keys to success.
3027,"well, Caddy has really stepped up on peace of mind. 4yr/50k bumper-to-bumper, 4yr/50k included maintenance, and 6yr/70k power train. Is there a better standard coverage offering in the lux market?"
3028,"Exactly. All these things are cyclical. Look at the reliability/warranty issues that Audi and BMW seem to experience. I would be shocked if Cadillac wasn't far superior. I tell you, if anyone drives an ATS like mine for any length of time, they are going to be won over. I was out in it today and it is the first time maybe ever that I kept driving around randomly, just for the sake of having fun. What a hot-rod hoot of a machine that thing is! I love it."
3029,"I'm trying to keep an open mind, but the only BMWs I could imagine owning are the M235i(w/port-installed locking diff) and the M3/4. Everything else from Munich bores me to tears(and don't get me started on the X5 and X6- I almost fell asleep driving the F16 at its international launch). I only want a manual with RWD, so that means if I stay German I'll be looking at a Cayman S."
3030,"I had no idea the ""coding"" potentials of these cars. Was always aware of ""the chip"" upgrade that would turn a 1.8 audi/vw engine into a monster- but never the technology to unleash options not paid for from the manufactures. Maybe buying el cheapo is the way to go."
3031,It used to be possible to unlock the Mazdaspeed 3 Grand Touring trim level's trip computer on the Sport trim level-it was all done through the audio buttons/knobs-but Mazda got wise and it wasn't possible on later editions.
3032,I just saw my SILs next X6. Very sharp. And big. Replaced her 2011 535x.
3033,"I'm ok with something on the boring side for my daily driver.  Point it south down the interstate to get to work, point it north up 3 different parkways to get home.  Speed limits ranging from 45 - 55.  I've learned to like my 175 hp, 4cyl, AWD, Legacy."
3034,"I put quite a few miles on a fully loaded X6 xDRIVE50i at the launch. Beautiful interior, totally uninvolving to drive. Sleep-inducing, to be blunt."
3035,Even my work beater has to be entertaining(hence the tweaked MS3)- and now that I'm 100% off the clock I simply refuse to buy a car that doesn't tick all the right boxes.
3036,"The one thing my Legacy has taught me is to appreciate a car for what it is with just some basic options.  I don't miss the sunroof as much as I thought & I actually prefer the slick top look.  Keeping that in mind, I ""built"" some ELLPS sedans to my specifications:"
3037,I have some sort of golf/GTI on the next car list.   Can't wait to look!
3038,"Flight- no thanks, I like o keep my cars clean, no modifications- only tints and probably mudguards. I can live with closing the trunk manually."
3039,"Just a FYI, coding does not effect warranty at all, it does enhance the whole experience, BTW, you can't code self closing doors."
3040,"The x6 is just a family truckster.  Pretty much a German explorer, so spiritual LTD descendant.  I don't expect it to drive like a sports car!"
3041,"Flight- nothing to do with warranty, I just like to keep things simple."
3042,"Yes, really. When I first drove an F10 535i the only thought that came to mind  was ""Old man's car."" My wife later got stuck with an F10 loaner; she drove it home, got out and announced ""It's nothing but a big soft boat. I HATE it!"" The sled sat unused until her car(an E90 328i) was ready to pick up. And most every magazine review agrees with me; numb steering and ponderous handling are noted in virtually every road test."
3043,Regarding the cheap 320xi lease here in Colorado.
3044,"My sister looked at the 3 series (320ix and 328ix) before settling on her Mercedes.  For the money, the 320ix with just a few options is mighty tempting.....especially with the 4 years maintenance included."
3045,"I'm sure it's a 39 month lease too, since Oct, BMWFS has been pushing the 39 months lease.. But someone on Bimmerfest leased a 320ix with Premium Package, Lighting package and Nav, his payments were right about what you quoted of $336/m, and all he put down was about $1100. Deals are out there..."
3046,"The maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get ONE free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals.  The real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50K bumper to bumper warranty., So if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50K and save yourself about $1200..."
3047,"Road- i guess this is all subjective because I would not give a 328 a second look, not even for my wife. Just personal taste I guess."
3048,"The 328i was the car she wanted so that was her call. It's certainly no adrenaline rush either- but at least it is possible to determine that the steering wheel is connected to the front wheels. BMW has decided to build the overwhelming majority of its cars to please people who wear their cars rather than drive them- and I'm afraid Munich will find that the people who can't tell which end of the car is driven, or ""need"" AWD, or think that a V6 is under the hood will prove to be a very fickle bunch of poseurs."
3049,"Oh lord, BMW is a car company in which it needs to make money, so they build cars that majority of people would buy. If BMW would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you Road don't buy enough cars to keep BMW open. Yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the Mazda 6, Camry, A4, and C class are bigger then their last generation."
3050,"Name calling never ends well- but like flight says a bmw does need to make money - thus the 320 was born. Its ""el cheapo"" bmw that plays many of rolls. It's got a bmw badge, it's cheaper then the old standard ultimate driver that came with a 6, it's holds value to get the lease payments lower (thus allowing ""poseurs"" to ""own"" one), it's great to put in print that you can lease one for 299 a month, It's also great having ""el cheapo"" in the showrooms as it brings in customers looking to go cheap then adding 10k in options or moving entirely up in class because that said bmw doesn't have nav or a cup holder. Point is all lux brands are doing this - makes sense given how close the base bmw (or other luxury cars are, around 30k) and how that compares to mainstream auto prices ."
3051,~
3052,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
3053,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties)."
3054,I'm not.
3055,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government.  The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat.  The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it."
3056,"BMW UK lists 46 variants of the 3-series with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel.  They don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and AWD options that would each have to be certified separately by the EPA at what I'm told is huge expense.  This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale."
3057,"How many miles are on your 2011 535xi?  What's the original in service date?  $20.5K for the TL is a testament of Acura's excellent resale value, you car's low mileage, and I'm sure it was in exceptional condition."
3058,Got it.
3059,"I received a e-mail from my BMW dealer that said, that all CPO 2011-12 models are on sale, with .9% for up to 3 years and up to $750/m for two months free payments.. But Bill did it right, have a big down payment and cheap money factor then a CPO is a great way to get into a luxury car."
3060,"I think you're probably right...either new or used I don't like paying for 5 years.  I should make whatever is purchased (new or used) fit in 3 years of payments.  When I get around year 4 I always have the inner dialog ""I'm STILL paying for this...""."
3061,So here is mini test of the new
3062,To much money  for a vehicle with these negatives.
3063,"Infiniti has been in a slow downward spiral, they really need to up their game"
3064,"I've tried to like Infinitis for a long time.  Every time I look at them and test drive them, I'm disappointed."
3065,I feel the same. I almost think of them as the Lincoln of Asian cars.
3066,"Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product."
3067,"Mark...as always, I like reading your posts.  And, can't disagree.  I also just realized that LG has a TOTALLY different connotation than the old GoldStar brand, even though they're the same company."
3068,"LG stands for ""Lucky GoldStar""."
3069,"Would love posters to not include the whole post of others - and thence spins to said post ""I agree "" as a responce- takes up a lot of space, and makes the responce  somewhat ""el cheapo"" aka bmw 320- to me. Sure its a responce (or a car in the 320) but is it worthy.  As others have mentioned the CPO finance rates are very close to new car rates. If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new. Love cars - like deals- why not get both. The infinit comments above may be true they lost the way but I can tell you the car was at some time a very capable machine for 3/4 the price- and for me in 07 seemed like a great fit- and after 7 yrs it was."
3070,"the mid range passing power is probably more relevant to 99% of buyers, since that is real world.  Unless you happen to do a lot of drag racing in your big luxury sedan!  a couple of tenths 0-60 in magazine terms in relatively insignificant in the real world.  I actually like the street start stat, since you don't get a lot of opportunities to brake torque off the line around here.  passing on the highway?  Merging?  Yeah, that happens!"
3071,"Because people lease cars for business purposes this is why they do get a CPO, the lease rates on them are horrible."
3072,"The resale value isn't that high on the Genesis sedan, but then again the MSRP isn't that high on them either."
3073,So the new
3074,"Looking to buy something for the wife, who drives about 2-3k per year.  Current 2003 Passat, bought new, has only 30k miles.  She wants to upgrade to luxury.  For a low mileage driver, does it make sense to buy a 1 year old car with high miles, then sell as a 4 year old car with normal miles?"
3075,If you can determine if it was used mostly highway and serviced correctly it would make perfect sense IMO.
3076,How about a brand new Buick (the really tiny one) -- the reviews of it as a teeny weenie luxury car have been positive.  That way you can have 100% new everything.
3077,Sarcasm?
3078,"makes sense to me.  a 1 YO with high miles is going to take a major hit.  Which is good for you.  By the time the miles even out to normal, you might not loose all that much in depreciation."
3079,I did the same with my s4- was 9 mths old had 14k - at the 2 year mark it will have less then 24k and at 3 years should be around 30. I don't drive. 2/3k a year closer to. 7-8. Part of reason I went used.
3080,So far here is what I like- this is just my personal likes and dislikes-
3081,WOW even my El Cheapo 320 has this as part of the premium package.
3082,"My local BMW dealer is offering $272/mo on a lease of a 320ix ... $40K MSRP and $2500 down (I suspect some of that is for the acquisition fee, but still...). Lot of car for the money."
3083,"I'm sure that is for 10K/yr too, but that $2500 down is steep,"
3084,"You can't compare a new car and a CPO, some people will only buy new, while others will only buy CPO."
3085,"I don't think any one will say the ATS isn't a good car, but for it to compete against cars that are bigger i.e 3 series and A4 and now the new C class GM needed to think ahead, that they didn't.."
3086,"A CPO is not a new car, pretty simple.. As I posted some people only want a new car, while others don't care."
3087,Flight- I was in that bucket (new only) until I bought this CPO 535- only 28k miles.
3088,"Bill, for people who lease, a CPO will not work, those who do not lease, a CPO is a great way to get into a luxury car without selling off their oldest child."
3089,"I can see going CPO if you've got cash in hand, or put a large chunk down and get some cheapo financing for maybe 2 years if you don't drive all that much."
3090,NY- I drive only 5-6K per year- I commute into NY via Metro North.
3091,That Metro North ticket is like a car payment itself!
3092,True but he can deduct the Metro North pass from his taxes.  You can't do do with a car payment in most cases.
3093,"I drive 8k a year and could of bought a new s4- but went slightly used, saved 10k or more, have full warranty, and know if I want to sell it I won't take a bath, paid cash plus trade- would do it again. First year depreshiayion is a [non-permissible content removed]."
3094,"There's no right or wrong answer to the question either.  I've only owned or leased new cars since I got my license (except for a used 1990 BMW 325i Coupe I bought for $950).  I am open to CPO cars especially in this segment for a future purchase.  Our Pilot is about a year & a half away from being paid off.  I know my wife drives it because we have 3 kids and need a big, family, truckster.  We could keep the Pilot around for kid hauling, car pooling, & vacation duty and pick up a CPO ELLPS for her to drive.  I'd look at an IS350, previous body style C300 4Matic, heavily depreciated CTS or ATS..."
3095,I would go CPO again and I probably will in a few years- the 650 XI would be coming off leases   then.
3096,"My wife's last two cars(her current E90 and the E83 passed down to RB Jr.) were CPOs, but I doubt that either of us will be buying another BMW; while their reliability has been excellent, driving excitement has gone MIA in the Fxx cars/trucks..."
3097,There are so many complex systems in today's  Luxury and near-lux cars that it might be worthwhile to offer how-to seminars.  A buddy of mine bought a new E350 and clearly hadn't had the time to learn  most of the systems.
3098,I don't think I'd do a CPO again.
3099,No lower class for me- always looking to upgrade.
3100,"I think some are missing my point, I'm sure Mark leases his car's for tax breaks, so buying a CPO wouldn't work for him. Buying a CPO can be a smart choice for some, just like buying new is a smart choice for others. Rick at one time was looking at a Lexus LS460 but the original sticker was over the top, even though the car residual for very high, the payments were higher then what he was willing to pay, so he was looking at a CPO LS 460. But he came to his senses and moved on...  BTW, leases residuals for Lexus's are out of this world, RX is 67%, LS 66%.."
3101,Same for the IS350 - residuals are nuts!
3102,You and I are in the same boat.  I don't want to be making payments on a car that's more than 5 years old plus pay for maintenance & out of warranty repairs.
3103,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less  and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
3104,"I agree with Sween.  And NYC.  NYC in that I don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 YO.  And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO."
3105,"That's what we do; we've had our newest car(the CPO E90) for 2.5 years and will probably keep it an additional 3-5 years. Our next newest car(the 2007 MS3, bought new) has been in the garage 7.5 years."
3106,"makes sense, and I have done the same thing.  How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car."
3107,"""makes sense, and I have done the same thing. How old it is when you get it shouldn't change your tolerance for how long to keep a car."""
3108,"To be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact.  Having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that.  It's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it.  That choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan."
3109,"I took a three year loan paying .90 bps (pretty cheap loan), they gave me 20.5K for the TL - I think I did okay."
3110,Now I'm confused; I thought you bought an F10 535i.
3111,"Twin scroll turbo is what billy meant, maybe?"
3112,yup- twin scroll.
3113,"I have a few pet peeves. One is calling an intake manifold a ""dome"""
3114,"""Serious Buyers Only"" is another of mine..."
3115,"You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively).  She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months."
3116,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7."
3117,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf."
3118,A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS.  We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet.  The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.
3119,"The emphasis has shifted from driving dynamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. I guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Cheap Trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."
3120,Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).
3121,"Mark....interesting take, as always."
3122,"I was recently browsing local inventory of BMW and Benz dealers.  One thing jumped on me - new C-class is in stock in good number - NOT A SINGLE unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships.  Even upscale C400.  All have MB-Tex.  BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point.  There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather.  I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good?  I just find it hard to believe...  Not to mention that not a single one?"
3123,In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic.  Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.
3124,"The MB-Tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however."
3125,"I'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. My issue is that today's buyers are usually distracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience."
3126,"That's also been my experience with BMW's ""Leatherette."" The"
3127,"WOW, I thought you weren't going to ever step into a Caddy dealer? What made you change your mind?"
3128,So it seems that Acura is having issues with the
3129,"I have leatherette in my 2005 Passat.  It has worn like iron and does not show any signs of wear or cracking.  Given a choice, I would take leatherette over leather every time."
3130,"And speaking of vinyl, while I do not belong to the ""LPs are superior, CDs are garbage"" cult, I dug out the AR-XA turntable I bought from my uncle(for $75!) and set it up in the basement HTS. Now to buy a Shure M97xE cartridge and a few accessories..."
3131,"Heh... I went down that road in 2007. I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again."
3132,"FN....it's a long story.  Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up.  Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out.  Cadillac is really stepping it up.  CTS has turned into something I never would have expected.  They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing."
3133,"I'm with Graphic on leather.  I drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great.  Rough touch, dull color and of course smell.  All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff.  Well, they obviously can get away with that.  Especially Benz.  I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend."
3134,"While at the MB dealer we test drove a ML250 that had the fake stuff, at first I didn't know it was fake, it felt like leather, and the contrasting stitching really elevated the whole look."
3135,Nothing beat the 1970's Chrysler Cordoba with the fine Corinthian  leather.
3136,"FN...no issues.  Lots pf vehicles competing in this space (E series, 5 Series, A6, ets).  Someone will find what they're looking for."
3137,I agree completely and the better the competition the better the cars...
3138,Man-I am loving this 5 series-this is really a nice car- I hope I don't sound too carried away.
3139,"Happy holidays- good to see the world of Ellps continues to drive on. The mentions of the IS250 and caddy cts - cads not talked of . I think the Lexi is an interesting looking car but as mentioned the drivetrain and cost for me it's a non-starter. The cts was car of the year - but poor gm they can't get out of own way when it comes to bad headlines. Caddy has a good car here but I would never own one (maybe lease) do to poorer resale values, some of which is due to continued recalls. This article from a website flight knows"
3140,"Well, I just leased a 2014 ATS 2.0T AWD and am really impressed. It is an incredible car to drive and I love the looks. Got a great year-end deal. Happy."
3141,"was at the mall today (what kind of idiot goes to the cherry hill mall at 4:30 on a Saturday just before Christmas?  Oh yeah, me.  And a ton of other fools!).  They had a couple of cars parked in there.  One was a Q50 (white).  Not bad looking.  The other was a black Acura TLX.  a V6 FWD tech.  MSRP $40,150.  Sharp looking car with the espresso leather.  Still seems kind of pricey to me, but pretty well loaded.  Though if I was spending that much and getting the HP, would probably want the AWD to better manage it."
3142,"Also, was reading one of my car magazines, and they had a long term wrap up on their ATS with the 2.0 motor.  overall really liked it.  small back seat, but you have to know that going in!  a few nits I believe (cue?), but dynamically sounded really nice (power/handling/MPG)."
3143,I thought the SQ had a supercharged V6 like the S4 and S6 have?
3144,Some quick (for me) follow ups:
3145,When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his  SQ5.  Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.
3146,"Long (food-centric) holiday weekends are for cooking, dining out (and over eating), going to places in your city you haven’t been to for years, movies, more movies . . . and test driving new cars (regardless of the possibility you would ever buy one)."
3147,UBER Car
3148,What year?
3149,2012-like new.
3150,"Sill looking. The only BMW under $65k that doesn't bore me to tears is the M235i; equipped the way I want(just CWP, H-K, and no hole in the roof) it is a tick over $47k- and that's not counting at least $2.8k for the mandatory port installed locking diff."
3151,"So maybe something like a 6.4l Challenger, perhaps?"
3152,"Well, that or maybe a 370Z NISMO- I've become the cross-shopper from Hell!"
3153,"Just Zainoed up the 535-, the Dark Graphite really looks amazing with the Zaino."
3154,"Both would be good choices.  C&D just had a nice write up about the Challenger....saying it could run with anything.  But, it belies its size and weight in doing so."
3155,TINTS IS NOT A WORD.
3156,I find P21s carnauba wax just as good as Zaino's  wax   if not better. P21s has  less steps to wax. Goes on and off effortless. Makes dark looking vehicle look like a sheet of glass. Been using this wax for 20 years.
3157,carnaught  .......................You'll get a kick out of this capped crusader.
3158,That's not
3159,Bap!  Nice shine.
3160,"The other Zaino advantage is no white marks on unpainted parts, in addition to its much better durability."
3161,The 6.4(392) SRT Challenger has some significant upgrades to the suspension- not to mention a more usable power curve. It
3162,Robr2- In this country we have a tendency to pluralize.
3163,"Well, brakes are easily upgradable at least.  Easier than engines!"
3164,"True enough, but NISMO is the ""Halo"" high performance model- just like AMG,  ///M, Mazdaspeed, SRT, or Shelby. I balk at paying to upgrade the brakes after I've already paid a premium for the NISMO model..."
3165,"Billy.....I like the 5...,especially as a 535.  Different class of car than the TL."
3166,gg- Will do!!!
3167,"Well I'm in Boston so in this country, the word tint is not pluralized."
3168,"My pet peeve is calling wheels ""rims."" Moronic."
3169,So here is the first test of the new
3170,But is it an ELLPS
3171,Nobody has had a problem with the A4 being ELLPS and that is FWD in base form as well.  1.8 is smaller but so is the car so the performance may be similar.
3172,"that C&D article said 6.5 0-60 for the 1.8.  That seems to fast, since it put the 2.0 quattro in the mid-5s."
3173,=====
3174,"mark - dude, you have way too much time on your hands!!"
3175,So here is a short Car and Driver test of the new
3176,61 large for a C class?  Wow.
3177,"Yep, that's what they cost with any kind of options. I recently priced one out for a friend who really likes options and we ran it up to $65K.  (He's not doing that, not on my watch)."
3178,The C300 with the Turbo 4 is their volume seller. The 400 has a V6 and here in Canada is $8400 more than the 300.
3179,Saw the older body coupe amg C63? (65?) today in a flat gray - sitting in traffic right infringe of me - I could not keep my eyes off the quad exhausts. Car was prob newer then mine but body showing its age a bit- but will continue to look great 10-15 years down the line.
3180,"So Acura is on a roll, here is info on the"
3181,decent upgrades.  New engine certainly gonna help.  Though not that much distinction from the TLX. Kind of surprised they didn't follow the trend and distinguish it by going with a 1.6 turbo or some such.
3182,"The first ILX was DOA, so anything will help. Still difficult to shake the tarted-up Civic stigma though."
3183,To me it seemed nothing like a civic though. Just not very fast.
3184,The Intergra and RSX had no problems shaking the Civic stigma.
3185,"Test drive a BMW 550i, Since BMW really doesn't have a car to directly compete with the S6, some would say a 535 would be close, but I think a 550i is closer, but the BMW would be faster. For 75K you get a car faster with roughly the same equipment."
3186,Both Q's  5 and 7  are nice.......... but pricey
3187,They didn't look like one either.
3188,Have you driven the Porsche Macan? I understand that it can be very competitive with the Q5.
3189,"There are ways, on the BMW forum I'm on they have Forum sponsors who always sell at invoice or below plus other incentives that BMW might have. I believe right now on 5 series there is a 2K rebate."
3190,"The least expensive Macan that Scottsdale Porsche has is $75K, that isn't a turbo model either.. So not too sure how competitive it really is with the Q5..."
3191,"Audi has a 1500 dollar loyalty  bonus for owners of a Bmw , MB, Lexus  which I qualify for. Looks like BMW has a  2k incentive also.  This just might be a Dec.  to........ Remember"
3192,"This is a Canadian comparison, but their Macan was cheaper than the (loaded) Q5:"
3193,"In the US, the Macan is about the same price as the SQ5.."
3194,So with people talking about the Audi S6 here is a Car and Driver quick drive of a
3195,A base Macan at that...
3196,"Spent some time driving my son's Macan recently, and was amazed with the handling and performance.  His was about $65K.   Has everything I would want.  Very impressive.  Only drawback was the 4 month wait time between ordering and delivery, which I understand is even longer now."
3197,"The XC90 is the larger of the two Volvo SUV's, we looked at the RDX and it felt cramped to us. I was surprised that the rear had the amount of legroom it had, but the head to roof test was the problem. Plus the new XC90 is coming in the spring with a price tag that starts with the X5, north of 50K."
3198,"I meant 60, since that is what you said you drove.  Freudian slip I guess."
3199,"I agree that for the price it is a bargain, by other issue with the Japanese is you can't custom their cars, it's take it or leave it. It's more the color combo then anything else that bothers me. Acura has a great blue, but it only comes in Grey leather.. Why not tan or Ivory..."
3200,"My wife wanted the nice blue badly, but they only offered it on the MDX.  The dark gray we got is nice though, and we have the tan interior.  Gray would have been nice too."
3201,"The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD.  The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money."
3202,"well, as always, money comes into play.  Big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" CUV to an RDX in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a European hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large."
3203,"We want to stay south of 55K, well I bumped to 55K, Rick didn't want to go north of 50K. But the Q5 with the TDI can't be had for under 50K with the Tech package..."
3204,"What was the reason for your wife getting the SQ5? over the X3?  I find the interior of the Q5 a much more inviting environment over the X3, but the X3 did handle better I thought."
3205,"Mark, entertaining posts, as usual."
3206,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot."
3207,"isn't the Q5 interior (and cargo area) on the small side for the class?  I remember looking at them before we got the RDX, and I have it in my head that it seemed very tight in the back."
3208,This is how I feel in regards to the Q5 TDI.... Gobs of torque that starts off so low and just pulls and pulls..
3209,I've seen a few IS350 F Sports around.  Those are really sharp & aggressive looking.  Probably my favorite looker of the current (classic) crop of ELLPS.
3210,"Mark, bravo...."
3211,"I just bought those Contis for my MINI---they do stick well but are also somewhat compliant, which I like. ""Skateboard"" cars like the MINI are harsh enough as it is.  Nice tires for the sporting driver who doesn't need to go to extremes on public roads."
3212,I run the Cooper RS3-A UHP all-season as the winter tire on my MS3(the Michelin PSS is the summer tire) and year round on my son's X3 truck. It looks like I will get over 45k miles out of the tire in each application. I will likely go with the Michelin  Pilot Sport A/S 3 when the Coopers wear out since the local tire shop I use no longer carries Cooper tires.
3213,"I actually replaced the OEM Dunlop Summer tires on my '09 XK with the Conti Extreme Contact DWS in order to have the slightest chance of moving on any kind of grade in the snow (not intentionally, but with Boston weather, you just never know when snow will strike....like Sunday morning!).  Of course, once I put th new sneaks on the XK, I traded for an AWD XF.  As I traded my newly Vredestein-shod '05 TL for the XK.  It would seem with me, new tires are a harbinger of new cars to come..."
3214,We did that with both of our Saturn VUE's ... new tires meant that it got traded in within a few months.
3215,"Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent Tire Rack test:"
3216,Also pricier I bet.
3217,I'm going to give a shout out for the Michelin Primacy MXV4.
3218,"UHP all seasons are fine year round for vehicles like my son's X3 truck, but I run summer rubber and switch to either winter tires or UHP all seasons in early December on most everything else in the stable- even my wife's E90 328i snoozemobile. In any event, I have a Wrangler Sahara equipped with winter rubber in case the snow"
3219,sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really SHOULD be done.  I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires.  I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.
3220,"Now in my second swap out and mark I agree it's not the best- I don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s. No perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either Arizona or Alaska. I would go to Zona."
3221,A reporter seeks to interview a recent new car buyer who financed through a 72-month or longer loan. Please email PR@edmunds.com to share your story.

3223,"I travel for work and for the most part get to drive many different cars over and over again, my current fave cars to rent are Nissan Altima, Chrysler 300 and Chevy Impala. The new Chrsyler 200 is nice looking but still need work.. But there is a new car company that is in select city called"
3224,"Regarding the Acura TLX: personally, the styling leaves me cold. Reports I have read are that it doesn't seem luxurious enough inside, with poor tech, and that the 9-speed autobox is not impressive."
3225,"Stick....S4 is equivalent to a BMW 335i.  Then again, it's equivalent to an Acura TL SH AWD that's a tad slower, too."
3226,"TLX seems like a nice car, seen a couple way better looking them old TL but nothing special- I can see how people would be turned off to acura front end.  Performance numbers seem inline/ or better with the 6 with top tier comp. I don't think I would be looking soon and would prob look elsewhere if I was to look."
3227,"I have yet to see a TLX, not just in Phoenix, but Seattle, Chicago, Miami, D.C and Charlotte. So far all the reviews have picked the 4 cyl as the model to get not the V6. Though I have seen lease ad's for the TLX with very low monthly payments. Now, I have seen many A3's on the road..."
3228,good.  it needs it.  keep price the same and could be a big winner.
3229,"OK, so cruising the manufacturers websites to find one of these gems that would (theoretically) fit my needs:"

3233,No tickets - but I'm not 100 all out all the time. I live up east- and know the roads I drive and where I can get away with a burst above 80.
3234,A reporter is hoping to find BMW owners who might have models with recalled airbags (mostly '00-'06 3 Series.) Please email PR@edmunds.com if you are able to have a quick conversation with the reporter today.
3235,Hey!  I qualify for that!
3236,"They'd probably love to talk to you since it's a ""today"" turnaround!"
3237,S4 M3
3238,Love the
3239,"It's hard to find a legitimate ELLPS below 40 grand.  There are some nice ELLS below 40 k, but they lack the ""P"".  Then there are also some nice ELPS, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. Ok machines, but not ELLPS.  Another part is base version vs. optioned.  Not just leather, but engine, sports suspension, or engine, will change the machine dramatically."
3240,"I actually looked back to the beginning of this thread (from 2002!).  I still think that the S4, 335i are a step up (middle level?).  The TLX, A4, 320/328, S60 still fit the profile for EL."
3241,For those considering a Volvo or the new acura TLX -or those who would compare both-
3242,"well, those are 2 cars I certainly wouldn't be buying if I was planning to go drag racing!"
3243,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot.."
3244,I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point?  Things have changed in 12 years.
3245,"If you are looking at an x3 and xc90, should look at Acura RDX. Instead to be comparable."
3246,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating.  The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6."
3247,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks."
3248,"entry level (as in the title) does serve a purpose.  If this is your first step on the ladder, nothing wrong with it.  Say, coming from something like my 2007 Volvo (aka the ""putt putt mobile"") the 320 is still a seriously nice car.  Is it the highest end?  No, but it is cheaper."
3249,Not to mention a very sharp looking vehicle. When this model can go further without a charge I may entertain buying one. I have been  seeing more  Tesla's  on the road this past year here in the  NY area.  The Telsa  S is not   cheap either at almost 80k.  Still not sure  if  its  worth the money even if you  could afford one.
3250,I do agree with you about  up here in the North East.  RWD is terrible in winter months   especially when you consider dropping this kind of coin. If you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's  fine.   Last I looked the driving range was under 300 miles. That to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. Local driving this car is fine. I drive from  NY to Myrtle beach  2 sometimes 3x a year. The Tesla  wouldn't  make it to  M.D without stopping to charge up................  LOL.
3251,How about the Tesla Model  X SUV. Is 70k worth a 95 mile range?
3252,"I priced out a fully optioned maximum, all you can buy Tesla during a test drive and it came out to just over $130,000.  Maybe ""entry-level"" for the 1% ?"
3253,"Hmmm...I don't think the Tesla is worth $130K at least not the current model. It's maybe worth the $75K level. Even the new ""entry-level"" C class Mercedes fully equipped, comes in at $62,000 and it's a match for the Tesla S at the moment, IMO--it even has more tech."
3254,I was cruising the used car listings and the local Ford dealer has a used Tesla on their site (pictures showing it in the showroom).  No price listed though.
3255,"As the Brits would say, I had a bit of a play with a Model S while driving a new 2015  X6 at the truck's international launch in South Carolina. The Tesla was pretty quick, but it seemed to slow and fall back the longer we ""played""- don't know if that was due to the driver, the batteries, or some other issue."
3256,"""IMO--it even has more tech."" I guess that depends what ""tech"" is important. Tesla could be considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever- from production to completion. It's overpriced for sure - and maybe it shouldn't be a comp to the s class- but it's got plenty of tech --maybe not the best radio - any 4 door sedan that can get to 60 in 3.2 seconds and now has an auto pilot feature is pretty cool- oh and it fits 7 people and yes doesn't need gas or oil change."
3257,"Tesla is all about technology, while I was in San Jose in March of this year, my niece took me her favorite hang out, a very upscale shopping and Dinning place called"
3258,"It might have ""tech"" but not the latest tech. It's really last year's cellphone already. There's no lane avoidance tech, no collision avoidance tech, no heads up display, no blind spot technology. You can have some of these features in a GMC Yukon and all of them in just about any luxury sedan built for 2015."
3259,I'm not sayin' Tesla CAN'T do these things--just that right now the car is no longer competitive.
3260,"""I'm not sayin' Tesla CAN'T do these things--just that right now the car is no longer competitive. "" you should read consumer reports about this car- or better yet go to the website."
3261,"Its the Model 3, actually. (technically, 3 horizontal lines stacked on top of each other), and the projected base price is $35k. Although I'm sure reality will see it creep higher than that. I think your $45k number may be much close to reality."
3262,The Tech Package that I have listed  is:
3263,"True, but Tesla didn't have to re-invent the wheel and go back to 1896. . It was all out there waiting for them.  This is the Auto Industry 2015, not 1955. You have to be on top of your game every minute, because your competition is clever, fierce and relentless."
3264,"Well okay we'll let it rest and sit back and see when/if the company makes an actual profit. That after all, is the mark of a successful automobile company."
3265,"Back on topic- In anti tesla style - I'm amazed how bad Infiniti has stubbed of late. For 2013 the ""g"" was retired but late in 2013 they announced they would keep the car and g label for another year and sold in 2014 a 2013 G as a new car. They never produced a 2014 G or Q? but for 2015 the old G will become they new Q40."
3266,"The new TLX with SH-AWD ought to be the IT car right now in this class (and maybe on this forum). Content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not MSRP basis, the Q50, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise."
3267,"I recall reading somewhere recently that it is selling well, at least relative to what it replaced!  And have seen some good reports. As always, have to filter the magazine stuff to get to what real people care about.  And no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models)."
3268,"Also, I kept meaning to question what gets counted here. To me, your S4 is not an ELLPS.  That would be an A4, or a 328i. S4 to me us another class, along with the M3."
3269,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option.  My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge.  I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra.  My TL's?  No extra charge.  And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better."
3270,"I noticed Mazda is charging $600 for metallic paint on the mazda2, so its definitely not limited to luxo cars anymore."
3271,"The only paint charge I saw at Mazda was $300 extra for the flashy red.  If the are doing it on the 2, probably why you can see them advertised so cheap."
3272,Actually it's $200 and it's for the white pearl mica.
3273,GM is doing this now too. Their nicer colors like White Diamond Tricoat and Crystal Red Tintcoat are significantly more money - I believe $1200 on a Cadillac here in Canada.
3274,"Some of those I think are actually special process paint, so probably actually cost more to do."
3275,"Regarding the vette, GM has stopped selling them as there are a couple of safety related recalls. I like the new C7, but why can't GM get it right when it comes to reducing the amount of recalls."
3276,"Every manufacturer now errs on the conservative side when it comes to recalls, stop sales, et al."
3277,"No, I haven't taken a look at the TLX yet. I'm leaning toward wanting a smaller car, however. My TL is a bit bigger than I'd like."
3278,"Charging extra for ""special"" paint colours is much like the high-end hotels charging an extra $10 per night for internet while Super 8 (and nearly everyone else) includes it in the nightly rate.  If you complain or feel you're getting screwed, you're not worthy."
3279,"Yes, of course, however, I was just pointing out that the C7 has been plagued with problems, first blown engines (Car and Drivers C7) as well as others, these are on early C7, as well as auto transmission problems and now safety recalls which GM pulled the sales of them."
3280,FN.....didn't know that about the 'vette.  My best friend just ordered a '15 convertible a few weeks ago.  I wonder if he knows production is held up?  He said he expected it by early-mid- October.
3281,"Its been interesting following C&D online, they talk about the issues they have been having with their long term C7, not a good thing to have a blown engine... I'm fully aware of issues that manufacture have, but GM has been plagued with them for years..."
3282,And not just on high end cars either- Mazda and Ford charge extra for certain colors.
3283,"I read the same article and it was overall positive on the vette- the other problems a punctured tire and a chipped windshield, sure the blown engine - they seem happy - as the header reads ""Our Corvette blew an engine but we still love it."""
3284,">  Audi probably thinks the only people that'll order a manual will do so despite the mileage penalty, >and there's so few they won't bother developing a 7 speed with 3 pedals."
3285,People still buying manual corvettes as take rate is 40%.
3286,"Hit 12,000 miles in the S4 the other day.  It has past my ""it better get through Summer without needing a tow truck post accident"" test.  Other than the body shop ""coolant hose"" debacle, it has been flawless and perfect mechanically.  No breakdowns, no problems, no issues."
3287,"The ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. I also think the reason for not supporting FLAC has to be the HD space. Since the files would be too large."
3288,"I have the b&o and recently had a 2015 loaner a4 non- b&o and found the stock radio fine but nothing special, it couldn't stream from my iphone.  I like the b&o as I'm usually listen to Rihanna and she sounds pretty good, I listen to a lot of streaming talk radio as well --For a real treat in sound I throw it in dynamic mode/ and hammer down- the artificial sound coming thru the car is all I need."
3289,The question is can you hear the difference in sound quality between a high bitrate MP3 and FLAC when in a car moving down a road and generating its own noise? I would be interested in somebody running a blind test to see if and how many people could tell the difference.
3290,"I think I answered that, and the answer is no, well unless you add about 200 lbs of sound deadening to the car. People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin.  This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD. Car audio in cars today are very good, for me, I think the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS460 is one of the best."
3291,The good news people the mark lev is awesome - bad news is its in an 80k msrp dollar sedan the size of Texas- more good news 10k off right now according to truecar.  How's the camry systems?  How's the system in the 320? I'm ok with the b&o from audi- just like I was ok with the bose from Infiniti - good radios - better the base but not like sitting in a movie theater or an Lexus.
3292,"In the 3 series there are two type of Sound Systems, Standard and Harmon Kardon (upgrade.) So in the 320 I have to standard sound system, however I have improved it slightly, I upgraded the amp and made the ""sub's"" under the seats more of a mid bass then ""sub's"" so over all the sound has improved. There is a thread on Bimmerfest about upgrading the standard sound system by upgrading the amp, for $45 was able to buy the adapter and a friend had the amp I did (he gave it to me.) 55 minutes of my time and I used the setting that people have recommended. Oveall, much improved, but nothing close to the B&O in the S4, or Lexus."
3293,Has anyone here yet test driven an Acura TLX Advance SH-AWD or a high-spec Mercedes C class?
3294,"The ""She's Too Fat Polka""!"
3295,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days.  With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure.  Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."
3296,"Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP.  Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there.  For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?"
3297,And now back to our regularly scheduled program:
3298,"Test Drove the S3 today.  I like the light feeling A3/S3 chassis, but my general impression is that the S4 is the closest to perfect car for Audi.  The S3 is just missing something.  Well, it's missing several things or doing serveral things not quite right."
3299,"Doesn't everyone here do that?  I'm not in the market, but find myself looking on my iPhone for pricing info anytime I take my car in for service."
3300,"Maybe not here, here.  In CCBA? I wouldn't be surprised if people were shopping in their sleep."
3301,"Yeah....probably right, Kirstie.  Fact is, I was looking at my TL's value on my iPad the last time I got an oil change.  My sales guy happens by, greets me, looks at my iPad to see I'm looking at trade value and invoice numbers on the TLX.  He laughs and said, "".....TLX is too new for a GG type deal.  I'll call you in 6 more months, though.  We van hammer something then when the supply catches up with demand."""
3302,And yet there is someone in another thread who would absolutely not consider the new TLX because of the commercial Acura created for it.
3303,"In fairness, I am seeing a number of non-professional drive reports from interested parties/potential buyers that are not at all positive, so that weighs heavily against it too. Could Acura have badly missed the mark?"
3304,"overall the in depth reviews seem to be positive.  as always, especially with individual opinions, you will find people all over the spectrum.  Always need to try for yourself!"
3305,Or you have better taste in music
3306,Not according to my wife I don't.....
3307,"AB.....from the reviews I've seen, the TLX is been rated from positive, to very positive.  You're going to have the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc.  They still want the ""blaaaaaat""  exhaust cans that you won't get on a TLX.  Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX."
3308,"GG, those are all the reasons it is attractive to me!"
3309,LOL that you even looked! haha.
3310,"The TL I think did take a hit from bad styling.  The RL though to me looks just fine.  Certainly not exciting or edgy, but conservative and reasonably attractive.  Definitely not ugly though.  RL was too expensive though, which hurt."
3311,"The RL lacks in looks, there is nothing standout about it, it doesn't say Q-Ship, the RL is the top sedan for Acura and it doesn't say that, very understated.."
3312,"The base TLX is very nicely equipped for $31k. I'm tempted to see if in 6-10 months good discounts are available....Otherwise, I'll probably go with the Accord again."
3313,"Although the TLX is based on the Accord, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. Here's some stuff from the Acura press release about that:"
3314,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon)."
3315,"oh, and as I typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the TLX on the Jets game.  So Acura is making a push for selling this car.  I think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content)."
3316,"Jets fans are huge target for acura, always has been that way- you go 10 seconds into Long Island and you are bound to find an acura. Just like today's game they are very promising but when it matters they can't score- very similar to Hondas acura but maybe this year will be different."
3317,I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.
3318,"TLong, did you try the TLX yet?  I haven't had interest in the TL since your series was destroyed by the last gen TL but I'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have."
3319,"I was wondering and doing a search on the nissan A35. Seems like Nissan has forgotten its roots.  Maybe turbo 4 / 300hp awd,or diesel awd  with stick option would be cool- but I'm dreaming. Looks like 2016 for those who care."
3320,Just read that Infiniti is going to bring back hydraulic steering to the Q50s because so many complaints about electric assist.  Wonder if anyone would consider it?
3321,"Nav discussion - interesting - I have had nav on both the g and now the audi- the g's touch screen and interface better - audi crisper (it's 7 yrs newer, dah!) and has the google integration - BUT I still use my phone more then factory- to all I recomend an app called WaZe. They were recently bought by google (a yr ago)- it uses real time driver info from users and the reporting is via users. Gives info on traffic, weather, potholes and best of all Cop locations. It reroutes on the fly- like if there is an accident 2 exits away it will tell me to get off and take service streets - wicked smart.  As I sit here there are 7500 users near by with 2300 reports this am, and 50 million worldwide users according to forbes."

3326,"I'm now have 3 ""flagged"" posts - what does that mean, hosts?"
3327,null
3328,Usually when someone likes something very much they remember the name. LOL.
3329,Anybody discussing cars here?
3330,"Wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- I would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura TL, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many TLs. Good luck with the search, church and Vensa."
3331,"I don't think many are confused between routine wear and tear vs. unexpected or repetitive repairs.  Everyone knows oil has to be changed, brakes wear out, tires need replacing, etc."
3332,"You should use more of the RDX- like going to whole foods - maybe hall some items from an antique shop.  nice little rig, Acura builds very good family haulers . Loved the old mdx"
3333,"Was Trying to figure how this Alfa fits ELLPs, read the article, then I saw the poster - any word on the new MB pickup?"
3334,"Didn't see you comment on the k900 besides saying it was a home run, but you have to agree Morpheus has a huge point here- which key do you choose flight?"
3335,Got it- so a k900 is not a sports sedan- it's probably closer to a Lexus ls type of rig.
3336,I love the brand lovers but if this puppy can compete with the big dogs- talking about cars costing 20k over - no reason we should not comp a 30k turbo sonata with a 35k cheapo BMW 320
3337,"Flight I traded my g in with just under 40k miles- had one 200 dollar belt issue- that's it. Had the Chance to get an s4 with bulk of warrantee - the comments are hurtful and crude- I never said it had any issues- please go back and check my views on the g. But as it got older I was afraid issues night arrive and like I stated was able to swap into a 13 s4 for much less then the price of a loaded 328x. - closer to the price of a 14 320x loaded,"
3338,"Typo- ""starting to worry ""should have been something you would have caught - will double check next time because I don't want to be attacked again. Bingo"
3339,"The value of a money I guess means different things to different people.  Acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainstream cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but I guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 Macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
3340,"Funny you mention the phaeton - what's the view on the genesis (k900)- or was the vw to early to this party- or better yet was the vw to costly to begain with-or does the Kia not work because of the badge.  vw started at 60 and went to 100k -had issues with reliability and was not marketed well, but as mentioned here as they might redo it for sale. - so maybe not totally forgotten."
3341,"Marks comments stand on own, you can love them or question them- I generally love his posts and they usually add something.  He's long at times and trys hard to explain things in verbose commentary which is his style. The ego driven explanation on LUx is nothing but rude, well educated in writting sure but let's be real- no one needs to know about the 4 1k pens one ones .maybe he was ""stroking"" his ego.- I understand people here are drawn to badges, I'm a city person who grew up in a modest environment and we are on an ELlps forum- this is not a BEntley forum- the category started with value oriented lux performance cars, entry level.  From post One on this board I have always stressed the dollar as being a major factor when comparing cars, research and overall drive as well.  That's why I don't understand the puppet mentality of some who just follow the badge."
3342,In looking at this I'm all for the 320- but would do a lot of research b4 strapping a performance mod even to a cheap lux sedan - 35k not a lot to spend on a car these days but I don't know if I could deal with the embarrassment of a blown engine and going to the dealership for replacement.
3343,"Don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ELLPs under that configuration, no it's not - Lexus once sold a RWD is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing I guess. Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really?  And done"
3344,"""funny thing though about the 320. People keep talking about it being a RWD, when in much of the country (at least the NE), almost every one at a dealer is an X drive."""
3345,"I have my front on with zip ties, string- and padding on the back of the plate itself to protect the lower bumper. It's ""installed"" lower on the body - I think it looks better but others could argue its doushie."
3346,How about leaving it on the dash does that work or must it be mounted?

3348,I have 18' winter and 19' summers (which I have yet to try) - both are uber aggressive sport - I guess it's a nature of that set up- I have base seats and which have good support and grip. The transmission very good for an auto - agree
3349,I guess or format still not taking hold-
3350,Pix
3351,null
3352,I've been gone for a while - new format and badges? Really. The one cool thing is the search has gotten better -
3353,Thanks FN.  Interesting that BMW went with the double turbo 3.0 instead of the usual V8s they've used in the past.
3354,"So far no pricing, but of course look for it to cost more then the out going model.."
3355,Thanks FN....Do you know when the 235 M is supposed to hit the streets?
3356,'Do you know when the 235 M is supposed to hit the streets? '
3357,"I don't need to update anything, it works on my car, it just doesn't on the loaners."
3358,"I understand, you're right.  Yeah, it may be worth a shot next time, I'm scheduled for a service to go and try an update."
3359,"I don't want to start an argument, although I am not against arguing, if that makes any sense.  But I was struck by the statements that things are becoming obsolete (perhaps the implication was ""on purpose"") every 30 months or so."
3360,What you are looking at is the user interface.  What I was talking about was the technology that delivers that user interface.  That life is about 30 months.
3361,"If you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?"
3362,"that a sporty car had a taut suspension that was cleverly designed to allow the vehicle to go around corners like it was ""on rails.""  It had a manual transmission that was fun to use.  It might have had some kind of big-boy engine that provided ~ 6 second 0-60 runs, but that wasn't necessary by any means.  It had some kind of audio system that provided entertainment on straight roads (and otherwise, but it didn't matter so much then)."
3363,"I have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while.  Three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both Apple and BMW.  I do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality.  BTW, my Nano has up to date OS, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it."
3364,"I'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se.  But, I do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in cars to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, PCBs, computers and software used to operate cars."
3365,"That is the question? After a great run in the G- yes it's been 7 model years and 38k miles - my G finally gave me some trouble- the drivetrain belt (alternator belt?) shredded on the highway a few miles from work- was able to limp the car into the lot and had it towed to dealer for the 200bux repair. Made me think time for an upgrade? But then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...I've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry. Checked out the new q in the dealership, nice looking rig but the consumer reports article still rates the g higher.  Plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo Audi s4. Both have great warranties - both great performers - but hearing the recent take on s4 issues has me worried, along with costs of course.  Could wait a year and do the s3, sure is a looker - prob tops out around 50k - has enuf hp to an low end grunt- but can I wait- love hearing the experience thou from the masses."
3366,"Although I wasn't as active a participant here (and elsewhere) whilst I had my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, I was a frequent reader of the postings and musings of those who participated those ""lonely"" 28 months."
3367,"I'm so far beyond biased, it makes everything I say possibly specious -- but I remain, after all, ""Often wrong, but NEVER uncertain"" -- but here goes:"
3368,"Sorry to here about your recent trouble with the G.  Glad to hear you were able to make it off the highway to safety & get the car towed to the dealer OK.  All things considered, $200 isn't that bad of a repair bill at all."
3369,"Test drive a 2014 Audi S4 S-Tronic.  Then, let us all know your reaction."
3370,"As far as technology advancement is concerned, I still don't understand why my $2100 NAV option on my 2013 BMW 328 doesn't speak out the name of the streets (text-to-speech) while my 5 years old $200 Garmin has been doing it for 5 years."
3371,"Thanks, FN.  Having driven an A6, albeit one with the 4 cyl turbo, for 3 weeks, I can't disagree with any of the C&D assessments.  In fairness, I haven't driven the new CTS, nor the new E350.  I drove a 535i during the BMW drive event.  And, I agree that it feels like a ponderous brick on the road (except, I too like the 3.0 Turbo motor, but more in a 3 series than the bigger, heavier 5)."
3372,"...I saw at least 3 of them yesterday.  In fact, I believe I saw more of them than 3's but I may be immune to noticing the latter since there are so many of them."
3373,"Finally, finally, the SQ5 which we technically ordered before the S4 is in and ready to drive home."
3374,"Mark, all I can say is: niiiiiice.....!!"
3375,So I guess Audi hasn't fixed your issues with your car.
3376,"Working on 300 miles thus far.  Taking it easy so far, but the car is simply in one word to summarize ""impeccable."""
3377,"Andres3 -- wait until you get over 1,000 miles on the OD; at that mileage the power improves and the fuel consumption drops.  I did notice a slight decrease in the oil level (on the MMI screen), but the indicator still says ""OK."""
3378,"So I haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in Tucson.  On my trips down and back, I have been averaging 36 MPG, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. The traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. Before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go."
3379,Nice write up FN.  Sounds like a very good car.
3380,"Graphic, I think one of the factors I think people are missing is the fun factor of a car. I don't remember which magazine I was reading but one of them did a write up on the original 320 and the current 320."
3381,Here is all the info on the new cars.
3382,"I recommend you exchange your lemon S4 for a real new S4.  After all, what are the chances you'll get two lemons in a row?"
3383,ray...my apologies.  I thought you had said you were moving away from BMW. I was wrong.
3384,"No, I it's also improved for longer term, according to Consumer Reports, not just initial.  The rank is based on surveys for several years back and represents forward projection of those results."
3385,huh. Interesting... kind of.
3386,I'll be the first to knock initial quality as a relatively useless thing.
3387,"Out of curiosity, you call the Neon yours but you've also said it was your parents.  Which is it?"
3388,Dropped the Audi off yesterday for another attempt for the dealer to fix the MMI and drivetrain grinding/binding issues.
3389,"graphic, there is a 8K difference between the turbo 4 and SC V6. You have to move up the mid level Premium Plus."
3390,"FN....just drove down to Lexington this a.m. in the A6.  It's a big car, obviously.  But, the 4 cyl turbo does indeed do well in ""normal"" driving.  I was quite surprised the amount of ""zing"" it has passing on the interstate.  If it were mine, I would have to ""chip"" it, though."
3391,"Graphic, this is how manufactures are playing the displacement game, with the turbo engine, allow the engine to make good amount of power down low to ""fool"" people into thinking it has more then advertise, also the 8 spd transmission does not hurt either."
3392,It was a joint purchase between my Dad and I.
3393,"The 2.0T engine from VW/Audi is indeed a great all-around motor.  It does work best tuned to Stage 1, 1+, or 2."
3394,The latest CR doesn't think too highly of the new Infiniti G27 follow on. Did anybody see that?
3395,"tlong....I didn't see the entire article, but I did see a blurb stating that Infiniti badly missed the mark (or something to that affect)?"
3396,The Cadillac CTS was the 2014 Motortreands Car of the Year.
3397,"""The Cadillac CTS was the 2014 Motortreands Car of the Year."""
3398,'The Lincoln LS (2000) lasted 6-7 years before it was discontinued altogether. That one left a particularly sour taste in my mouth. '
3399,I agree 100%.  wasn't the Neon given the COTY award too?
3400,Another potential ELLPS contender
3401,"Keep in mind that Motor Trend Car of the Year doesn't mean it's the best car ever made or even available.  The award is given to a car that is all new or substantially changed and is judged on superiority, significance and value."
3402,"First, there are good intentions, then there's execution, and last there's follow-through."
3403,ray....I've been reading a lot about the S3 recently.  I wonder if its performance will encroach upon the S4's turf?
3404,"Probably, but you'll have to live with a smaller car."
3405,"andres....interesting car (S3) nonetheless.  I agree, the S4 will probably be a larger vehicle with more amenities available."
3406,"Sorry about your issues.  Such a great car, such a waste.  Your MMI issues just made me realize, two 328 loaners I had in past year had both refuse to play the iPod nano I have - it's the slightly older generation.  My own 328 has no problem playing it, but those two brand spanking new ones, did not recognize it.  Same cable, same connection, same brand.  Much smaller issue, of course, not even my car, but it just tells me when it comes to electronics, it's always a crap shoot.  They charge you full price, but when it doesn't work they tell you what can ya' da - it's electronics, it's new, it's cutting edge (by that they mean, it cuts or it works on the edge of failure)."
3407,"Andres, there is only so much one can do to these engines before things start to break."
3408,That s**ks. Why something costing $150 and more should not last at least 5 years.  What kind of mindset is that?  My Nano is about 4 years old.  That's way too short for new cars not to recognize it.
3409,"Dino, you got me thinking, I have two two iPod Nano's first generation and third, My 320 plays what is on my iphone with no problems, plugged in my thrid Gen Nano with the current iOS and it played, I'm charging my first Gen Nano and will give see if it needs an update and will give it a try."
3410,My Honda's don't need the car on.  I prefer that.
3411,"well, obvious answer, build a bigger garage."
3412,"It is safer from a security aspect to disable the opener unless one has the car key but it does make it a little inconvenient at times.  If I had my choice I would probably like it NOT to work when the key is absent.  Can't think of a many times where I used the Homelink without having the keys on me.  In fact, I don't know if mine will work without the key or not...I'll have to check.  I've got a fair amount of equipment and tools in the garage to steal, let alone have them available to break into the house in complete privacy from inside the garage."
3413,"Mark, my 320 has 1200 miles on it most are by Rick, he had to go to Tucson for his Uncle's Funeral, on his way back he was pilled over for speeding. , he direct quote was, ""I can not believe I was doing 80 the felt more like I was doing 60."" He was given a warning. Whe I drove the car up to Prescott I too was surprised on how one has a hard time ""feeling"" the speed of the car, Ricks Genesis is the same way. As I wrote the engine has a Effortless about it when cruising on the highway that none of my other BMW's had. E46 built up the speed, as well as the E90 did. I keep hearing Rick mention how much he likes driving HIS BMW, maybe I can persuade him to trade his Genesis in and I can get the S5 I was looking at..."
3414,Not sure if I gave you both the official congratulations & mazel Tov on your new rides!  Best of luck to you both & use them well!
3415,"""The E46 was and is today the best 3 series BMW built."""
3416,"So what is the best 3 series? Now I'm not talking about certain model, but overall 3 series, series."
3417,"Man....you could make a case for a lot of candidates for ""best"" 3 series."
3418,"Graphic I know what you are saying, I never owned a E30, driven many of them, but for me the E46 was it. Perfect balance between pure sport and lux. You could take my 330i on the track during the day and then out to dinner in Scottsdale without missing a beat.  The suspension was rougher then I would really like today. The current 320 has the typical tectonic feel with a slightly softer suspension, but if you want more sport, order the Sport Package which gives you the M sport package..."
3419,"What is ""tectonic feel""?  Something is shifting under you, like tectonic plates?  I'm not making fun of you, I just don't know what you mean."
3420,I am guessing it was an auto correct or a typo and was supposed to be Teutonic feel.
3421,"FN...I'm thinking your 320i is the ""new"" sweet spot for a 3 Series that offers the ""sport"" of ""luxury sports"" sedans that I'm looking for."
3422,"I would urge you to get the Advance, not Tech version of the TL.  I got a 13% discount on my 2012, Advance, so my guess is they have more to play with in that car -- and you will get the 19"" wheels which both improve the turn in and looks."
3423,Mark...thanks for your insight.
3424,'The M235 intrigues me.'
3425,Is this your first transmission issue?
3426,"buenas gente de la mañana, y feliz día de los muertos, aquí en el suroeste se trata de un día muy especial."
3427,Happy Halloween to you too Flightnurse:)
3428,I have a feeling you are going to end up with TL #2.  Just an educated guess!
3429,"Ivan...IF (big IF) it takes a month to get and install a new trans (all the associated parts have to be ordered, too) I think I have a good case for lemon law.  In addition, the car has been in the dealer's service dept for numerous other issues (some of which couldn't be resolved...like MMI issues) for another 10-12 days (I have to tally them up)."
3430,"If your sister doesn't have a TL SH-AWD advance, driving her TL could turn you off of getting one."
3431,Surprised they didn't recall the whole lot of TLS due to styling alone- we all know what happen to Pontiac for giving us the Aztec - this is a similar situation
3432,"Just curious why a Volvo S60 isn't on your list of cars to consider?  I have an S60 T5 FWD and it hits all of the sweet spots for me at a reasonable price.  Only problems I've had are a loose head liner and finicky memory seat.  BTW, consistently getting over 30 MPG on the highway on regular.  I know it doesn't have the status of other cars in this category, but I recommend you take one out.  You may be pleasantly surprised."
3433,"Mark...my sister does have an SH AWD Advance.  So, does that come with the 19"" rubber?  I know the brief time I drove hers, it is indeed a nice ride."
3434,"Yep, all TL SH-AWD Advance cars came from the factory shod with 19"" wheels and tires -- the tires, ARE V rated, which is a good thing; however, my 2012 really was transformed when I upgraded to UHP A/S tires."
3435,"""Ray...I thought you were done with BMWs? Do you know when the M235 is supposed to hit the showroom?"""
3436,"I wonder if you actually have oil monitor, or it's just a software.  I'm not aware of any manufacturer having a real oild quality sensors there, from what I heard and read, it's all calculated based on driving, but I may be wrong."
3437,"No problem, I understood.  Just stating the obvious I guess.  I really have no idea how the ""oil monitor"" works in the Acura and it really doesn't matter all that much to me.  I would get the oil changed at one year or about 7500 regardless of what the ""oil monitor"" or the owner's manual said.  Unless, of course, the owners manual was even more stringent."
3438,"You guys peaked my interest.  Since one of the local Benz dealers is close to my home, I wandered over there last night to look at the CLA.  They had 2 of them (they said they initially had 4 but already sold two).  One was $38K MSRP.  It didn't have leather, nor the ""fancy"" diamond grill you see in the TV ads (it's an option)."
3439,m6...I pulled this out of my old file when I had my TL a few years ago.  This is what Acura stated about the oil life monitor...
3440,Thanks.  Acura doesn't really say how it's done but I became curious by this discussion and found this:
3441,"That is true, but none of those also put a 7 speed dual clutch with nearly 260 lb-ft at 1200rpm.  Plus the MB has style those cannot touch."
3442,"""It seems strange that so many ""electrical glitches"" happen in German brands very early on."""
3443,"Dino, I'm not too worried really, I'm figuring that the car has no real miles on it yet and the computer will start ""analyzing"" how it is being driven and recalculate when the next service should happen."
3444,"The currently CTS (2014) is narrower then the  the last generation, yes it is longer but the shoulder room is where it counts to many people."
3445,"I'm guessing the ""oil Monitor"" works based on temps, driving style, whether it is stop and go traffic or highway, the speed in which one drives throttle position and over all how one ""drives"" the car. It would be interesting experiment to take two identical cars, drive one how normal people would drive and then take one and drive it hard, take it on the track and see if the oil monitor stays anything different and if the one who drives the car harder would have to come in for service sooner. OR does it matter with the new Synthetic oils how hard or easy you drive the car.."
3446,"Ivan, the new do-dad's that cars have a nice and at times make for a easier trip, one thing I wish rental cars had was Nav, so far the only rental I have ever had that standard nav was the Infitii Q45 (The Whale) it was nice since I wasn't too sure where i was going, but I just use my phone the other times since the new goggle maps integrates well with the iPhone and when connected to Bluetooth and comes through the speakers."
3447,"Michaell...I agree with you....the auto industry has become so finely segmented, it really is starting to blur from one car model to the next."
3448,Keep in mind that the CLA is not the smallest offering .. they offer both the A and B class overseas (and the B class in Canada as well).
3449,">>To each his own. IMHO, the styling of the CLA is overdone. MB seems to be overdoing the blades and cuts on the nose and tail."
3450,"Hey... that's how I usually see it, too..    If I think it looks great, then everyone else feels the same way... or, they are wrong...  ;-)"

3454,"With a $3,000 price increase, BMW is taking the apples to oranges marketing plan.. and letting Audi and MB battle in the entry level sedans (CLA/A3)."
3455,I thought that wasn't due until 2017 model... when all the dust would have settled by then...  (by then Kate Upton might be over the hill and Usher will be on tour with Lionel Richie)
3456,Quick take: 2014 S4 S-Tronic (333 HP 325 lb ft).
3457,"Mark when it comes to HP, the German's have always done it different.  If you take the BMW 335i, the car makes 300hp and 300 lbs of torque, however, ifyou look at the times it run, there is no way that a 300hp car can run that fast, and dyno test have proven over and over again that it makes more power. Also the 7 spd DSG helps too.  I also believe that engines today make power more efficiently then before. My 320i only makes 180hp and 200lbs of torque but the passing on the highway is effortless..."
3458,"As for why the magazines aren't testing the S4 with the others, it may have lost a comparision test with one of the others in the past, I am not sure how old the current A/S4 is.  Also the may be justifying it by testing RWD performance sedans, maybe they will do an AWD test later ( not saying it is right, but might be their thinking).  I think generally the first answer is the reason ( same reason the c-class isn't in the tests).  That said I am sure the A/S4 is right up there with the others, and depending on what you are looking for may be the best."
3459,"Drove from Cincinnati to Columbus and back yesterday -- on the way back, crossed over to 1,000+ miles on the OD."
3460,"I'm not a big car enthusiast.  Back in 2006, I was reading these forums for Audi and BMW but in the end bought a Honda because I knew I wasn't going to be driving much -- the 7 year old Honda has just over 23k miles."

3463,"Graphic, I have only driven the car about 200 miles, but so far..."
3464,"With the new crop of cars coming to the US, Audi A3, MB CLA, will the A4, C class, 3 series be considered a ELPS?"
3465,FN...thanks so much for that review.  I enjoyed it.
3466,"When did CR hire automotive testers that use phrases like ""The Lexus IS handling is short on finesse, with vague-feeling steering that doesn't telegraph much feedback"" and ""The Q50 isn't as much fun to drive as the G37. Handling is mundane, due in part to dull steering""???"
3467,"Graphic, I like Bimmerfest and F30sport and I'm learning all about this new car. BTW, I was looking at a S5 and almost pulled a trigger on a S5, when I decided to do my experiment."
3468,I read a comment above that seemed to me to be saying that I would exclude using Costco gas -- because it was not a top-tier product.
3469,"My ""favorite"" car -- of all of them I have ever had -- used to be my 1995 Audi S6 (the first year the car was called an S6, previously it had been called an S4). This car had been my favorite from an emotional perspective, not that the '95 S6 was a performance slouch (it wasn't).  I actually had cars (mostly Audis) that were, perhaps, 'better overall' -- but none that could capture and frame a certain period of my life."
3470,"Clarification, the base CTS on the lot I was on was 51K and this did not include leather, it has Nav and moonroof.  I guess what I was saying was, for a car that is smaller then 5 series and slightly bigger then a 3 series, the CTS is almost like the red headed step child..  now I found it interesting that the CTS coupe was less than the sedan by a good 5K.."
3471,Are you sure you were looking at 2014 models?  The new coupe hasn't even been introduced yet.
3472,"I experienced first real failure in my now 2-year old 328 wagon.  It was the liftgate latch assembly.  One nice morning the car is showing ""gate open"" warning, so I got out, closed it again.  The warning is still on, so I try again and again.  No avail.  What's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog SUVs) would not open.  As it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window.  I'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module.  Sign of times and designs - 10 cent capacitor or resistor fails on a small circuit board and you get full-blown $500 repair."
3473,"Mark....still wondering why the Audi S4 isn't included on these trade rag shootouts.  Wondering if Audi, like BMW, really doesn't want to promote their ""hot"" sedans?  Most of the reviews center on the A4, like the reviews on BMW's 3....rarely do you see a review on the 335i."
3474,"I just had the trunk latch replaced in my car for the second time.  First time it wouldn't latch when it was below 40 degrees.  I had to press the unlock button again when the trunk was open to make sure it closed.  It was replaced with a faulty unit which would unlock, then lock again when the button was pressed only once.  They replaced that yesterday."
3475,"Interesting.  Perhaps they're going cheapo on those items.  Not a good feeling, is it?"
3476,"It seems strange that so many ""electrical glitches"" happen in German brands very early on.  I'm not sure how many take place later as it seems so many of them are leased and you don't hear much from the people that buy them used.    Makes one wonder if actually kept past warranty?  I realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money.  I had a 10 year old Infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced.  I currently have a 10 year old Toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced.  We also have a 6 year old with Mazda that has never had  a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles.  However, I just replaced a halogen headlight last week on the Mazda for a grand total of $8.99 and about 10 minutes of my labor."
3477,I don't know.  And for some reason I didn't test it before I left the dealer last night.  It still doesn't work.
3478,"You do make some good points.  This is a minor annoyance.  I wouldn't bring it back to the dealer specifically for this trunk problem, but I have complained about it and the problem has supposedly been fixed 3 times."
3479,"How does the oil thing work if you only drive, say,8k a year?  Would you actually go two years between oil changes?  I know my Acura manual says to go by the oil monitor or 1 year, whichever comes first.  Is it the same on the BMW?"
3480,"I know my car was made specifically in Munich.  Not South Africa, not North America.  One failure does not make a pattern, so we will see how that works.  My guess that certain part suppliers are local, but others may be global.  If a part is small and easy to ship large distances  in large quantities, but requires some specific manufacturing (electric motors, electronic modules, etc.), there is no reason to split suppliers.  Bulky  items, easy to spec and manufacture (seats, liners, interior, sheetmetal) , a different story."
3481,"I don't think it's the Eastern Europe issue.  Most electronics today are made in East Asia or Eastern Europe, it is all controlled by handfull of companies.  I think it's more about attitude and cost controls.  Relays, electrical items have certain lifetime designed into them (say X hours).  One rated for half of those hours can cost one tenth of the price - and it looks just the same.  It becomes irresistible for them to try, especially that chances are, majority will work for much longer.   That rating may come from statistical sampling that certain percentage will meet the time criteria and to achieve same percentage of the the longer time, manufacturing process would have to be redesigned, making part that much more expensive.  Cost-benefit for manufacturer becomes such that it's cheaper to deal with higher percentage repairs than pay for one that lasts.  Why Germans do that and Japanese stick to better quality?  This may have to do with cost of labor.  There is only so much you can do to add efficiency.  German labor is simply most expensive, not just due to wages, but also additional costs, from social security, to taxes, to benefits.  Only so much can be paid out of customer's money, before they refuse."
3482,The price I'm quoting for the coupe was on the Caddy's web page.
3483,"My 320i is telling me that my first service is due, 4-15-2015 at 15000 miles.  Well over a year in service... As this is part of an experiment I will follow what BMW states as recommended to see what happens."
3484,"I had same thing and asked about it (it was even showing 2 years from first oil change date).  They told me the date is based not on paid schedule (which is 12 months), but on ""latest"" the car should come in the dealership in case somebody drives very low miles.  You still can/should come at 12 months, even if the mileage is not up yet and they'll pay.  They told me it just has to be at least 12 months plus 1 day.  The April date seems just to latests to maintain your engine warranty."
3485,It is the mileage or 1 year.  You are correct.
3486,Flight nurse - I'd get that checked out.  I had a brand new 328xi (60 miles) & saw it needed service @ 10K.
3487,"You actually can go more than 1 year between oil changes, according to my guy.  The car has the programing do-dad that anticipates next service depending on driving.  I don't think synthetic oil gets old, not in one or two years, anyway, so one could drive on it.  As I recall, my then new car had similar cutoff date as FN's, 18 months, when car was new and then it switched to 2 years after the first oil change.   However, BMW will pay every 12 months, so why not do it?"
3488,"Since the owner's manual says max of 1 yr or by the oil monitor whichever comes first, I'll follow that schedule so I don't have to worry about any sort of warranty problem down the road.  My oil monitor had just dropped to the 30% oil life left  when it hit one year.  The power train has 6 yr warranty so I want to maintain that with no questions asked."
3489,alltorque...I agree.  The BMW oil change intervals is probably a function of the dealer revenue stream than it is with the oil breaking down (BMW uses synth oil).
3490,"I don't know - these 2.0 turbos are still only 3 years in service, it is possible that they got some statistically significant results prompting them to shorten the mileage between changes.  It wouldn't be visible from an average person's view (his nearest dealer's garage), as not many of those engines reached 100K miles yet, but from corporate view they might be seing emerging patterns for those subsamples of the long mileage engines across the world.  Just saying, it's possible."
3491,"I think is was around early to mid 2000s.  There was definitely a coincidence between increasing the period and instituting ""free"" maintenance."
3492,"Another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease:  the amount of oil that the European cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a Japanese ""premium"" car requires."
3493,"I know I had a late '80s 325i (first BMW) and an early '00s 330i, in addition to the E92 coupe I had.  The last one was the only one I remember having free 4 year maintenance.  So, you're probably right Dino."
3494,"""Another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease: the amount of oil that the European cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a Japanese ""premium"" car requires."""
3495,"Not to pick on your word choice, but I would call German car schedule ""aggressive"" and Infiniti's ""extremely conservative"".  Now to answer your question:  Infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines.  For those not to sludge, I suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often.  I guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent.  I feel that if Infiniti suddenly changed the schedule to once per year good quality synthetic, the dealers would lose all those revenue upsell opportunities."
3496,"When I used the word ""aggressive"" I was referring to the aggressive assault on one's wallet so I used the word correctly but didn't use my turn signals to indicate the direction I was coming from.   But when someone says they have THE answer to my question and then says ""I suspect"", ""I guess"" and ""I feel"" I have to wonder about their word choice as well.  But that doesn't change the fact that I would tend to agree with everything you've said."
3497,"Whoa!  Now you're picking on my words.  OK, here it is: my choice of words was very careful to precisely express that I do not have a real knowledge, just conjecture and constructed narrative.  However, I should have not written that's ""to answer your question"", but rather ""to speculate"" or something like that."
3498,"Whoa, what?  I can't question but you can?  Yeah, you should have wrote something like ""I think I have the answer to your question""  You made it sound like you are the authority on Infiniti oil change schedules and then went on with your answer which is a WAG at best."
3499,"Just playing.  For the record:  I am NOT an Infiniti authority, nor any other brand."
3500,This is just getting silly.  Let's get rid of the sarcasm and hostility.  I'm about in a bad enough mood between this discussion and another one to start removing posting privileges without any notice.
3501,Our Infiniti doesn't use synthetic.....
3502,Can't any car use synthetic if you want to?
3503,Yes.. but recommended intervals are based on the oil it comes with...   which was my only point..
3504,"Last July I bought a 2013 S60 T5.  I was shocked to find out that the oil change intervals were 1 yr. or 10,000 miles, with synthetic oil, of course.  I've been a 3,000 to 4,000 mile oil change type guy, but have never used synthetic oil.  Volvo provides the first 5 oil changes, per their schedule, at their expense.  So when I took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought I was nuts.  Someone else who I consider knowledgeable in this area said I'm wasting money and resources.  I did have the oil changed again at 10,000 miles, free.  I've recently come to the conclusion that I will have the oil changed at every 10,000 miles.  I guess I'll find out in 5 yrs. or more as to whether this was sound advice."
3505,"Jeff...with synthetic, you should be good.  Of course, engines are pretty complex, that operate at extreme temps, both cold and hot, dirty, greasy, dusty, etc.  So, something can always go wrong.  My guess is, the oil change intervals will not be the culprit, though."
3506,"Volvo S60 T5 in Europe is oil change at 18,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first. This assumes correct viscosity and spec. Engines are same on both continents. Volvo oil specs are universal I believe, (SAE 0w-30, ACEA A5/B5), so.................it's all to do with greed and nothing to do with oil quality or engine life.  10,000 mile changes in Europe would be cause for rioting in the streets. Even using ACEA A1/B1 poverty spec it's 12,000 miles. Same old same old."
3507,"I agree, but there is another side of this.  It is much easier to get a warranty honored in the US than in Europe, not just with cars, anything manufactured.  The manufacturers find many inventive ways to walk away from their obligations with impunity over there.  I found there is also much more goodwill here as well (major repairs after warranty with manufacturer's cost participation).  One can say the goodwill is ""prepaid"" in those short intervals."
3508,"It seems that Audi, BMW and soon Volvo (among other Euro brands) are quickly becoming car companies that motivate virtually all of their cars with some form of a forced induction engine. Turbo charging seems to be the go-to forced induction technology.  Audi and Mercedes use superchargers in some applications -- but the majority of the Euro brands (and also starting to show up in non-Euro brands, to be sure) are not naturally aspirated any more."
3509,I believe one might see a shorter oil change interval on turbo engines.  I wonder how the oil sensor gizmo on the current BMW turbos schedules it?
3510,"is ingrained in a truck owner's (doesn't apply to company drivers) daily routine:  let it warm up before going full-throttle and, much more importantly, let it and the cooling (oil & water) systems stabilize before shutting the engine down.  I let the EGT drop to300 degrees or lower before I shut down (and it often took 2 - 5 minutes) -- prevents coking, among other things.  It's not often that a mechanical engineer ends up being a truck driver, but when it happens things can be learned."
3511,cdn...it will indeed be interesting to see what the recommended fluid change intervals will be with turbos and super chargers in more and more engines...especially the brands with longer warranties.
3512,"Sorry, cannot agree with your statement re warranty in Europe.  Can't talk about engines as I don't know anyone who's ever had a failure. However when my '06 Volvo S60, (see above), was annual-serviced 2 weeks ago the Volvo dealer updated the engine management software FOC and checked to see if there were any reported extra safety checks flagged by Volvo, (there weren't). Standard, no hassle servicing."
3513,"Read my above post ref Volvo S60 turbodiesel oil changes. Whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to USA, at least in volume terms, they have been around in Europe and Japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. Oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. Of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. After a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal."
3514,"I guess it may vary from region to region.  Eastern Europe seems to be still ""customer service challenged"", at least Poland is.  Basically any kind of warranty work used to be a torture there, authorized service stations are still not reliable source of quality work (it's a crap shoot),  press is full of reports of denied warranties under most bizzarre pretences, or smallest customer infractions.  It is getting better, bad publicity and social media are putting more and more pressure.  I would not be surprised if Western Europe, having much longer and better established consumer rights and customer service, was much better."
3515,I think I'll stick with the S4....not even close....
3516,"well, the S3 is going to be the competitor, right?"
3517,Mark -
3518,Property values will prob move higher on this swap as well- nice congrats
3519,"FN....I rent cars through a military program as I do quite a bit of business with Lockheed and Boeing, and fall under their rates."
3520,"My S.O.'s company has a deal with National, and he likes that (now that he's used to it) because if you're a frequent renter, you get to pick your vehicle.  I think getting to drive a variety of cars is the only thing keeping him from getting the ""new car bug"" at home!    They used to be with Hertz, and that was great for the ""I don't have to talk to anyone"" feature - just your name on the board, go to the slot, and your car is there with keys in it, ready to leave."
3521,I remember when Enterprise told me getting an Accord with a V6 would probably be a Premium level 2 car rental equivalent.  It was then I knew that the categories rental car companies named don't make much sense in real life.
3522,"Yeah...the whole ""We try harder"" ad campaign for Avis really doesn't fit them any more.  It should be more like ""We don't care""."
3523,"robr2....I know for many years I threw Avis a lot of business.  Then, for no reason than I can ascertain, their ""customer service"" went down the drain.  I only use them as a last result, now."
3524,The CTS VSport has the new twin turbo 3.6L with 410HP. That's the one that is nudging the $60K price point.
3525,In the CTS V Sport =
3526,Just the facts:
3527,Sounds wonderful.
3528,Sounds like a great car to me.
3529,"Man, I must be sicker that I thought, I forgot the one deal-breaker option I got on the S4: Audi Side Assist."
3530,"Agreed; Audi allows you to pick ala cart items from the ""PRESTIGE"" package with the ""Premium Plus"" package, therefore making the PRESTIGE package pointless unless you like every item it includes."
3531,"I don't want to high jack a thread, but for the company I work for we have a contract with all the rental companies, and I continue to  always go back to National. I like that I can go to any car under the awning's and take it without a problem. Lately there has been some interesting cars, I just had a Volvo XC60, as well as S60.  I average  60-75 rentals a year and never had a problem with National, that I can not say with Hertz or Avis."
3532,"Mark...major congrats.  Yours is identical to mine, with the exception of the seats.  I know you're going to love it."
3533,For $60K I would find a CPO BMW M5. Then Id go trolling for Corvettes and 911's  :P
3534,"I've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the S4's MMI system parameters -- including Audi Connect (free for 6-months).  In terms of ease of use, the MMI user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive.  What I do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 A4 Prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the MMI.  I had to chuckle when I pressed the CAR button and was presented with the ability to set my INDIVIDUAL preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""Comfort,"" ""Auto,"" or ""Dynamic."" This option must be there simply ""because they could.""  I guess when your car stickers at north of $56K, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak."
3535,"Mark...glad you're enjoying the S4.  I agree with everything you say.  The Audi connect wasn't worth it to me, either.  In addition, during the trial, it was painfully slow."
3536,"Just attended my dealer's model introduction event.  Not a very good one - they simply grabed first available salesman and gave me their standard test drive.  The only difference between the ""event"" and standard day at the office was they had vehicles lined up and ready, so no time lost in searching.  And fancy appetizers, and small gift.  Not really comparable to those manufacturer's events."
3537,"Seems they are recognizing their prices went bonkers.  There seem to be ongoing cash incentive for a few months now, they call it option allowance.  It even applies to newly released 2014 versions, like diesel, or GT.  They can call it whatever, bottom line they used to have cash incentives only during model switchovers, seems now it's on everything.  They should be careful, as it's very difficult to turn off cash incentive mill.  They may be thinking it's better to give people a deal than lower price, but I don't know.  Brand dilution is usually more pronounced when sold on X off basis than when retail price goes down.  Anyway, I predict free leather may come much sooner than on previous platform."
3538,"dino....BMW has always seemed to be more focused on leasing.  As such, they've often subidized their leases pretty heavily."
3539,"Well take a look at the new Cadillac CTS Vsport pricing -- $59K+ base, $60K+ nicely equipped."
3540,"Yeah, I know.  I don't fit that crowd.  Even if I bought things with short term in mind, I never found a lease I liked - at least so far.  It was mostly because those models I got DID NOT have as good lease incentives, as those volume models.  Converted money factors were higher than purchase interest rates, even before rolling in lease fees, and residual is only slightly inflated,  which was the case for my current wagon.  Basically the deal would have been nothing to write home about, so why would I lease?  My previous cars were Subarus and those guys don't inflate residuals at all - in fact STI I bought in 2008 had a very bad residual when compared with what I could actually sell it for after three years.  But 2011/2012 was abnormal, as tsunami crippled the Subaru's supply and inflated the their used car prices, which I think is the case even until today."
3541,FN...any further impressions of your 320i?
3542,"I just discovered something that does not make me feel that great.  BMW changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12K miles/12 months, from previously 16K miles/12 months.  This means they either had too much resistance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue).  What about existing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule?  I'm not very happy.  Seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated.  The only consolation I can think of is that my commute is at least 75%  highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current BMW lineup is all turbocharged.  From my previous turbo owning times (had two Subarus with such engines), I know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin).  I may be OK long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think BMW was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods."
3543,Would be very surprised if this was an oil-capability issue.  It is almost certainly a dealer/revenue-driven issue.
3544,"""Which gets us right back to the Acura....easy-peezy on reliability and maintenance"""
3545,"billy.....personally, I would buy my own airfilter and install it.  What would that cost?  $15-$20, maybe?"
3546,"I think the AWD TL is the same as the RDX and they add in rear end diff fluid changes that the FWD version obviously does not need, and they are every couple of years."
3547,"Thats exactly what I did- i bought my own (parts) and I will take to my mechanic for istallation, air filter, oil and filter change and maybe rear diff (dont think its needed at 24K)."
3548,"If cross shopping was considered, I wonder if MB execs were sitting around pissed at blatant cloning (Genesis) and said lets build a sub-$30k car that's a better looking Sonata and see how Hyundai likes that."
3549,"I don't know if I posted that my wife ordered a 2014 Q5 3.0T P+ with the sport interior, nav, B&O, blind spot monitoring, etc.  Thing is, as is her ""policy"" we test drive the crap outta anything she is even remotely serious about.  Once she had it down to the Q5, it was a matter of ""which engine?"""
3550,Congrats!
3551,"I believe you are right.  When I started out, pre Audi Club discount, the dealer offered 5% off.  The ACNA certificate bumped it up to 6%.  The dealer discounted the Q5 MORE than 6%, so the ACNA discount wasn't the best deal."
3552,"Congrats on these cars.  Great choices, great colors.  I've always liked the white/red leather combo since (gulp) the 70's.  Either this or the black with red, I think are among the nicest.  The great thing about a red interior is that it isn't drab like black or light beige interiors. It's also easy to keep clean and every time you get in the car, it really pops and you'll be energized. (Can you tell I like red?)  Anyhow, good luck, and keep us apprised."
3553,"""Good bye Acura TL, good bye."""
3554,"i just bought a 2010 tsx when i got home i wanted to check the oil, when i pulled out the oil dip stick i noticed that it was black not like the ususal silver ones i have never seen a black one, i couldnt even tell if the oil was clean or not untill i used a towel and saw that it was a bit dirty, my question is...is the oil dipstick supposed to be black and why would the oil not be clear, the dealership did change the filters cleaned the whole engine before i took it home"
3555,"The A12 does not include the rear diff; that is a 6 in Acura-speak. A12 should be oil change, filter chg, pollen filter and tire rotation."
3556,Would be interesting to drive an S4 back to back with the full Quattro (rear differential add-on) vs. the BASE Quattro AWD.  To me that would be more important than the inlays.
3557,markincincinnati....congrats.  Mine is Ibis white with the black leather and alcantara seats.
3558,"mark is an Audi Connection guy, I think..."
3559,"First off, congrats Mark on the new purchase's.. One question, I was not aware that you can get any other color interior than black with the sport package, every time I built an Audi on line and choose the sport back, the interior would default to black glad to know this isn't the case, Rick has been looking at a Q5 on line.."
3560,"Don't know why, but those Audi Connection people (part of the Joseph Group, who also own the Infiniti dealership, among many others) aren't particularly easy for me to deal with."
3561,"Graphic one unique thing really is, I'll be able to compare it to other cars, I'll be driving rentals more then my own car, so far the 2014 Impala is my car of choice to rent. I wish national would have TL's but no dice. Plenty of G37's though."
3562,FN...seems as if most of the rentals I've been getting lately are Mitsubishis (huh?).
3563,"Both my wife's Q5 and my S4 came (or will come) from Greg @ the Audi Connection.  My wife's 2011 FX35 also came from another Joseph dealership, Infiniti of Cincinnati."
3564,"Graphic who do you rent through? I only go through National since the company I work for has a contract with them. Two weeks ago I was in Burlington,VT, and rented a Volvo XC60, interesting SUV, no Impala's. But for the most part the bigger cities I arrive in have them now."
3565,"I had a real estate agent once tell me that he never regretted or had buyer's remorse with real estate, since unlike cars, they don't depreciate right away.  That was 2004."
3566,"Mark I have to ask you this (not that I am getting personal), but dont you have around 18 months left on your TL lease?"
3567,"The situation with the TL is that I have 10 months left on the lease.  At the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means I would owe about $5,000 to walk away from Acura.  Acura, unlike Infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount.  My wife bought 18K miles per year on her lease, I couldn't do that."
3568,Congrats to you both on your new cars!  Interesting we are going to have 3 S4s on the board here.
3569,"So mark, just curious.  If you had kept your TL until the end of the lease, what is that car's residual?"
3570,I'll second NYC.
3571,I saw a Q50 on the way to work this morning. It was a metallic burgundy color and looked really nice. Whoever it was who said a few days ago that the Q50 looks better in person than in pictures was dead on. Its a really good looking car.
3572,"I cannot argue with you, its your money-Good luck with the S4."
3573,"The Audi Prestige and Acura Advance pose at least one question I intellectually understand but ""just don't seem right!"""
3574,"Saw an IS350 AWD F Sport  & Q50 for the 1st time on Saturday night.  I had to do a double take when I saw the Infiniti.  Thought it was a Jaguar XF at 1st. Looks so much better in person than in print and on TV.  Style wise, it definitely looks the part of a $50,000 Sport Sedan."
3575,My local MB dealer had several CLA's on the lot Saturday when I stopped by. All were priced around $36-37K. Did not get a chance to sit in one as they were mobbed by customers.
3576,"Michaell...thanks for the update.  I'm mildly interested in the CLA.  But, from a sports sedan perspective, my antenna tell me it's going to fall short.  I've never really been a fan of MB interiors, either."
3577,"gg - with your past experience with the 335i and S4, I suspect the only iteration of the CLA that will interest you is the CLA 45 - the AMG version with the 355HP 4-cylinder."
3578,Graphicguy - I wonder if you might take a liking to the CLA 45 AMG...?
3579,"I have to scratch my head, I was in Montvale, NJ before heading on vacation and spoke to a factory rep who was driving a CLA, who told me they MB hasn't released them yet, so I went and checked the three MB in Phoenix, 1 has 12, 1 has stock photos of them and VIN# for them with prices and the other doesn't even list they have any on their web site. I like the interior and exterior of the car, but I don't think it will have the driving dynamic that we look for in a car. The back seats are very cramp...."
3580,"Michaell....you may be right, and that I would like the AMG CLA.  But, reading these types of reviews isn't making me want to venture over to the Mercedes showroom any time soon...."
3581,"I think the CLA, not having driven it, will be competitive given it's price.  It seemed the reviewers wanted E class refinement in a $30k vehicle."
3582,Maybe not - Mercedes is chasing the sales crown hard.
3583,"I agree on many points you stated, that could be said for most expensive cars, it's about being seen and in what not the technology that is in the car or that was used to built the car."
3584,"I bet when push comes to shove, the $5,000 in options will be demanded by the consumer, especially the lease and payment buyers."
3585,"MB is not trying to sell CLA to anybody in this forum.  Look at the Willliam Dafoe commercial and you know who their target audience is.   Those people wouldn't know if the car is FWD, RWD, AWD, propelled by jet engine, or rotor in the back.  BTW, not to know Mercedes, same applies to majority of 3-series buyers, or any other car/truck/brand.   Probably 25% of population understands the difference and 5% actually cares."
3586,"I think a lot more people spending $30-40k on a car know FWD from RWD than you think.  They just don't care that much about it.  It's not stupidity....it's priority.   And knowing the mechanicals inside and out is just not a priority.  My wife know virtually nothing about cars but she can tell you that our truck is RWD, our Acura is AWD and our Mazda is FWD."
3587,"Either way, they don't care."
3588,"Value buyers would be frustrated, badge buyers, like the kid in the CLA commercial, would take that three arm star and low payment, even with plastic interior."
3589,"I agree that MB is looking to ""hook"" the 30-ish person who might might be looking at a loaded Accord or Camry (which in my mind, would be the better buy all loaded up with a V6)."
3590,"I don't think you're being too harsh, gg. These are all good points you make."
3591,"This vehicle - like the 320/325 - are offered to meet a price point.  Notice that all the advertising on the CLA is targeted to the price.  Heck, you can lease one for $349 a month with $3600 down."
3592,"If you want 320 without maintenance, make sure you don't get sports line.  Its summer tires will go at 20-25K, other lines have all-seasons, which may last the whole lease, but they may go around 30K-35K, just before you turn it it.  You may get away with skipping alignment for three years, I guess, especially if you don't need to change tires before the lease is up."
3593,I dont think FWD will hurt sales.
3594,Michaell.....$300-$350 lease?  That should be  right in the 320i wheelhouse.
3595,"And, I doubt that many people will cross shop a Mazda 3s GT with a CLA 250."
3596,"I agree, Mercedes and their Chrysler-like horrible reliability (at least while joined at the hip with them) scares me, even to this day."
3597,"tifighter - I think most forums software platforms have some similarities, but vbulletin, as I recall, didn't offer us the kind of flexibility, support, and features we needed.  I think they just sell their software, and offer a bit of support, but we want more than a sort of box-package plan."
3598,"Would be nice if that was gone.  Another thing I really miss is a ""future models"" section that old Edmunds used to have.  It always had a newest updates of the state of the knowledge about future models, sometimes not entirely accurate, because it was based on available (inclomplete) data and a little speculation/conjecture, but it was a good source of what was likely coming down the pike.  I'm wondering why it was removed.  Too hard to maintain and not enough interest?"
3599,I agree with you sweendogy about the current G37X being a fantastic value.  A friend of mine was just in an Infiniti dealership this afternoon.  They offered to lease him a 2013 G37X (no navigation) for 24 months with absolutely $0 down for $325 per month (including 6.35% tax).  That's a deal!
3600,"Yes, and yes.  However, again... the new platform has more flexibility and we hope to see more ""future models"" talk there, and potentially create more future model talk.  If you mention your interest in a Future Models category over on the discussion I linked to, it'll be noticed."
3601,Kirstie....thanks for the update.  Have been through a total WEB site revamp with my  company.  Not fun....especially when you're also changing WEB software and hosting sites.
3602,"Graphicguy, I have heard somewhere that Tesla has tried to establish themselves as one of the companies and car manufacturers that has the online communications with its customers. Of course, as most of users will not be able to service their cars online, they still have to have actual service centers. Provided that most of us still have to test-drive the car before the purchase, I guess that this also involves dealerships. Therefore, I believe that the best way for you to find your information is at"
3603,"We are just finishing a new website at my company. Originally marketing was saying they thought it would be ready in March. Not live yet, so its a typical website rollout."
3604,What kind of sales price would be equivalent to that lease deal?
3605,"Although I had read the R&T comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (Monday 9/23) -- and I re-read the Q50 v ATS v 335 v IS 350 F-Sport article.  I assume you could infer that I am carrying Infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car."""
3606,"Your findings on the S4 are the same as mine.  Which is why I ordered one lightly optioned and got the dealer to agree to take only 50K out of my bank accounts (don't worry, CA will take about 5K more before it's all said and done."
3607,"Mark...you'll get not rebuttal from me regarding the S4.  Drop the ""pearlescent"" paint, the hi-zoot seats, and the ""whatzatstuff"" trim, and you should be able to make a case for a low $50-ish check with your dealer (but you'll probably have to go to Beechmont Audi to make that score)."
3608,"Thanks, well, if it performs as reliably as my '06 A3 with 104K+ miles, I'll be a very happy camper."
3609,My friend didn't remember the particulars of the exact sale price.  The MSRP was in the $37 - $38K neighborhood
3610,"andres3....don't use my experience as a measuring stick.  I came to the conclusion a while ago that both dealers around me have relatively inept service depts.  But, as long as they keep me in some nice loaners (which they have), I'll put up with it...at least until the new '15 TLs come out."
3611,"Even with all the revisions, the 2013 TL (especially the 'Base' model) is not appealing to me in the least.  It's not blatantly hideous like the 2009 version, but it's so bland looking down the boring wheel design.  The Special Edition looks much better, IMO."
3612,"Having leased the original 335i (before kids) it was the best drive I ever had even tho it was in the shop for a blown accessory belt and the High Pressure Fuel pump.  The service, loaner car and refund of a lease payment does offset the inconvenience."
3613,S4: Bland styling (I had a 02 A4 1.8t and there hasn't been much change)
3614,I took that statement referring to the design exclusively...meaning there hasn't been a dramatic change in design; such as the new impala compared to the old one.
3615,"LOL, the difference between the 1.8 T and 2.0T is worlds apart if you ask me, and that's the 200 HP 2.0T version."
3616,I know -  it was just a frame of reference for styling and how Audi used to be the leader and now seems stale and now Benz is the most progressive.
3617,"For me I still can't get over how the C-class cars, (and I'm guessing the CLA) don't have body colored roof seams (or even better, no roof seam rails at all (ala VW/Audi)."
3618,"The interior of the S4 with two options -- upgraded seats and the ""pinstripe suit"" dash trim is drop dead gorgeous."
3619,335i vs S4.  Have owned both.  S4 wins.
3620,"The CLA has been the cause of a decent amount of journalistic drool for months and months and months.  The tarted up version has caused some who write about cars and get paid for doing so to be unabashedly aroused, in fact."
3621,"If your 6'2"" or taller the IS350 may still be a tad ""small"" for your tastes."
3622,You guys are making me want to take an IS350 for a test drive.  Might as well take a gander at the GS350 while I'm at it.;)
3623,I saw the CLA in the showroom and the interior is clearly not the same as E class and probably on .
3624,"FN...it seems like they've had the CLA announced for a year.  But, as you say, they aren't even in the showrooms, yet.  By the time they hit, all that ""pre""-delivery marketing will have been forgotten."
3625,"Mark, styling goes a long way with people, I'm not a fan of the new look Lexus is going. It can win all the comparison test it can."
3626,Not that I'm a leasing guy - the stats provided about are interesting. Why is Infiniti keeping this G around another year at discounted pricing? Is it to claim a market share gain vs the big boys ? I don't get it. 150 bux diff a month is real money on a car you don't own anyway.
3627,"They've reduced the G37 lineup to just the RWD Journey and Base AWD models and they've cut the base price by $4,800 on both.  So the G37 Journey RWD starts at $32,550 for 2014 compared to 2013's base price of $37,350!  The only options available are the Premium Pkg (Leather, Moonroof, Bose) and Navigation Package."
3628,"G37 might be an old design but put it up against the old tL, the tsxthe Audi a4 2.0 or even the new BMW 320 and its a huge bargain agreed.  Throw in a fancy lease lease rate and bam, market share. I still don't get it thou. Why confuse people more - every car will be a q right - but this ones a g.  At these prices makes you wonder why one, a person looking for a performing sedan and a deal would consider anything else - that includes the new q"
3629,The only reason to get a Q50 over a G37 is if you have to have a bunch of sensors and cameras to help you avoid accidents.
3630,"The interior of the G is Nissan like because its what Nissan took in later years from Infiniti, perfect example is gage cluster of maxima. I'm sure the Camry has Lexus like interior as well. Look the G is a 7 year old - it's not as modern as new cars but in function it all works very well- and given pricing its uber competitive."
3631,Seems like Infiniti is nowhere near a market leader in this segment.
3632,Thats like saying I like apples - what's the point you are making? Any value to go along or just a broad swipe with no real point?
3633,"New Q50 is advertised all the time. Two ads:  one ad is ""break from convention"" with pretty young people on assembly line getting Benz or BMW and one guy breaking from that.  The other one is about its new psychic feature, i.e. alleged ability to anticipate accidents two cars ahead."
3634,"Again - please post next time you like apples. when have they been priced higher?  ""growler engine"" have you read any of the reviews- they say they are the opposite."
3635,Interesting short article on where Infiniti is heading.
3636,Thank you - value add
3637,Do you like apples?
3638,"That will be enough, thank you."
3639,Very welcome
3640,"Looking for a used one (automatic) that is 1 to 3 years old.  Would keep it long term, 10-12 years."
3641,Been there doing that (sorta)-  back in '04 I bought a used '00 BMW 528iA and paid about what a loaded new Camry would cost.  I still have it over 100k miles later and have had very few major repairs.  In fact I've had such good luck that I recently bought a '01 BMW 330Ci Cabrio which is also giving me great service.
3642,"While I'd admit I've been an Infiniti fan for the 6 years of ownership I've also been one who has always done the backround work, the research and have always been a person who has posted with more then just opinion, now I say this with the new q50 I think Infiniti has done itself a great disservice by not pricing this car lower- that being said with the current cut in cost of the old g37 - it's become far and away the best car in its class even at its advanced age.  For those of you who post with more then opinion please go to true car and tell me what car on the right had side of this page has the performance, the features of the g at this pricepoint. Case in point price out a 320 x drive with sport and a couple of options - real money don't lie- the G is still the best car for the buck in class- and now we can thank Infiniti for the q for making this more of a landslide."
3643,I know you are busy dealing with tough posters but what about adding the q- maybe delete the tsx- now the only Ellps with a 4cly car only (sorry I think 5% are 6cly)- but it's always been here even as posters have said it should not be.   Maybe move the tsx for the q or the new caddy which has now been around for 6mths and all mags think it should be included -
3644,"Read an article in the Chicago Trib this morning about Edmunds.com doing a complete revamp of it's main site which will debut around the middle of August.  Reason I mention this is Edmunds has always been slow in ""fixing things"" on these forums and with this new roll out of the main site the chance of making tweaks to this forum are pretty slim IMO.  Maybe sometime in 2015."
3645,"We aren't making any ""tweaks"" to the forum because we'll be migrating to a new forums software platform in the near future, and our efforts are focused on making that a smooth transition, and also getting everything we could want from a software platform taken care of before we move."
3646,"Thanks.  Didn't have a clue that the forum side is being redone as well but on a different schedule possibly.  Hopefully it will go better than several previous so called ""upgrades"" to the software.   But while I can be a little sarcastic about the track record it is still a free forum and no intrusive advertising to put up with which is appreciated."
3647,"Well, hopefully the new format will retain all of the features you like, and just add some more that you want.  We've been busy testing it, and we're really pleased at how responsive the company is to our requests.  We'll be doing a lot more testing prior to launch to do our best to make it a smooth transition."
3648,"As long as new platform has fewer ""Not Found"" incidents, I'll be happy.  There were weeks when I almost gave up."
3649,"They're in our list of requests!  ""Not found"" will *hopefully* go away altogether."
3650,"I'm picturing vbulletin here, but that's only because I'm not aware of many alternatives..."
3651,Maybe it will look like the new Apple iOS.
3652,Any guesstimate about a timetable for the forums change?
3653,Review in Car and Driver of Q50S Hybrid -- not especially encouraging if you are a fan of the brand.
3654,"No one is saying a test drive should not be used- but for someone, who is not constantly testing cars to write a review and that said review would be taking over a car mag is just ludicrous. I think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun. Not saying the information and experience was not of any value, but just less then a James Healey or consumer reports- and another few ticks lower then c&d and others."
3655,"I totally agree -- the early report from C/D however is a bit of a bummer (for those who were rooting for Infiniti and Johan, of course.)"
3656,"Mark- have you read any other article on the car? The few I've read and watch are actually glowing, you mentioned the c&d one which I guess was about the hybrid. For those of us looking at a SUb 50 sports sedan would not consider a hybrid. Sure tesla has done it right; but what other hybrid is a real all around Lux sport sedan and at a price point of 50k, which I think is redik ."
3657,"I test drove the car, admittedly a sample of 1."
3658,"So I'm sorry to hear the IS350 has some flaws - I'm surprised a guy who just got an S4 would even bother wasting time, not only yours but the dealers- on such a car - certainly hearing about how good the s4 is and also how much of a good deal the a3 was for you."
3659,"""15 minutes is quite a bit of time to get a reliable impression."""
3660,"I drove the Q50S AWD recently.  Loved it.  The article from C&D, while disappointing, wouldn't change my mind.  I was and continue to lament the apparent lack of marketing savvy Infiniti has demonstrated regarding the Q50 -- but I will wait (for another year) to see how Infiniti does under the watchful and experienced eye and hand of Johan (as we know -- 19+ years at the helm of Audi of America, who does a great job, typically of marketing across traditional and non-traditional media)."
3661,"""24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak"""
3662,Mark..
3663,"We test about 10 cars per year, escalating, sometimes to 12 or 13 -- I never said we test drive 24 times annually (although we have friends who are well heeled who seem to get a new car every spring whether they need one or not -- meaning they test a LOT.)"
3664,"Hell, the Infiniti dealer told me they have zero, zip, nada plans to even STOCK RWD Q50's -- dealer trade or special order only for the RWD versions; so, yep, we test drove a Q50S/AWD with every option except the TECH Package (the package with the blind spot monitoring system). The AWD factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest BMW store's sales manager told me ""well over 50%"" of the cars they sell are X-drive"
3665,Well.. I was going to say...   An AWD Infiniti with all-season tires would be a real pig compared to a RWD IS350 with summer rubber...   Hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison...
3666,"I found the IS 350 RWD F-Sport I drove to be a bit more cramped inside than an A4/S4.  Both less leg room, less width, and a lower roof line.  Roof line matters to me a lot, I'm 6'3"" tall, and I'm not skinny anymore."
3667,"M6, sorry for the delay in getting back to you."
3668,"""You and flight should car pool to these dealerships."""
3669,"I can't remember if the ""cause"" is local or if all BMW dealers do what is done at one of the dealerships here in River City:  About once a year (it could be more) I get an invitation in the mail, followed up with a voice mail message inviting my wife and me to test drive as many BMW's as we want (all in a single day)."
3670,"Yeah.. the whole flap with Planned Parenthood put the kibosh on that deal, I think...   It almost killed the Komen organization.."
3671,"Mark I too took part in the same event, was able to drive some cool BMWs, this is where I fell in love with the 550. I liked the fact that no salesman was with you while driving the car but they had a ""plan"" route for you to take. BMW severed their relations with SGK and Ford pick it up for one year. AS you pointed out it was a great way to drive BMWs..."
3672,"BMW severed their relationship with SGK before the whole planned parent hood debacle. I had my own issues with SGK, just a tib bit, before a participant could do the 3 day walk, they HAD to raise a min of $2500... Which I thought was very unfair. There were other issues I had with the organization as a whole their corporate (politics)  leaned towards women which I was not happy since men can get breast cancer too. I think BMW did the right thing to distance themselves from SGK... Now back to our typical of why we by the cars we do."
3673,"I preferred the S4 over the TL -SH-AWD model, but one of the biggest was just simply that I preferred the looks and styling of the S4 inside and out to the plain Jane TL."
3674,The Lexus IS wins again!
3675,Same message in Motor Trend comparo of the Q50 to the IS -- Infiniti just can't get no love.
3676,Reading that article has opened my eyes - the caddy of the group comment wow.  Agree the new naming stratigy is a disaster and will Prob hurt them for a few years. Stupid if you ask me- every car is called Q because 20 years ago they had a car that started the brand.
3677,Strictly from an exterior perspective...the IS doesn't work for me.
3678,Since the CTS is listed here:
3679,"My 2004 Volvo V70 had an MSRP of more than $32,000 when I bought it. My wife and I went looking at cars last weekend and fell in love with the Subaru Outback. AWD, leather, moonroof, bluetooth, etc... And MSRP was just over $30,000."
3680,"""The S4 is far from an average car though "" yep we get that'and somehow the rear camera is not standard, prob because its a performance car and the 2 extra lbs would slow it down."
3681,I gussed you lucked out.
3682,"""give a short impression of your time with the new Impala"""
3683,5 USB ports - thing must way a ton.
3684,Tks.  My wife will be looking for a replacement sedan in the next 6-12 months and the Impala is a possibility.  I've only seen a couple on the road and I hear they are in short supply at dealers so the fact that you can get them readily at the rental counter is unusual.  Guess they wanted to get them out to be experienced by many and the people that tend to rent full size autos are probably their target audience on the most part.

3686,"Johan de Nysschen has his work cut out for him. The new head honcho of Infiniti &#150; formerly of Audi (of America) for almost 20 years &#150; has to do for Infiniti what he did for Audi.  He must take a run at making you think of BMW (or Audi) as the German Infiniti.  Tall task?  Well, based on the lethargic launch of the Q50, I don&#146;t envy Johan."
3687,"I just read an article about sales of 3-series going gangbusters.  Basically another piece of evidence  that enthusiasts don't matter, at least in short run.  People are lining up to buy this ""sports sedan"" probably for reasons why the same people didn't buy them before - it's big, comfy, easy to drive.  But it's a BMW, so it must be sporty, right?  Since they've never sit in a true sporty car, if they had, they thought it was uncomfortable crap, how would they know the difference, anyway."
3688,"well, maybe it is no longer ""sporty"" to old school BMW types, but for anyone coming out of mainstream cars (Camry say) or a Lexus it is certainly a major step up the sports sedan spectrum."
3689,"Exactly, it is all relative.  All they have to do is convince enough people it's better than the alternative.  The funny thing is their competitors are moving toward that point from the other side, making it very crowded market with small differences.   I guess that's inevitable in world of mass production, one has to cater to least objectionable rather than try to stand out.  It's the price for going from niche to global."
3690,"dino...stickguy....I think you both hit the nail on the head with the 3 series.  BMW did cash in their chips on the new one.  But, they've been moving away from sports sedan into more mainstream waters for a while now."
3691,"""No sure what that means with a car that just hit the streets."""
3692,Of course.
3693,Couldn't you use the dealer's website to see how many of a particular model are available?
3694,"I didn't mean specifically, just in general they always use some kind of come on like that.  In the Q50's case, I don't think they are desperate yet as it just hit the dealerships a few weeks ago and from my few drivebys of the the local Infiniti dealer it didn't look like they had that many Q50s in stock.   I think you are reading way too much into into an email from a car salesman."
3695,"You may be correct.  It may be as simple as a relative ""we have large choice and the guy across town does not"".  It was Mark that planted the thought in me that Q50 may not be selling.  It certainly is too early to tell."
3696,"Depends.  Some services that the dealerships use list ALL inventory available at that dealership as well as nearby dealerships.  I've seen dealership personnel complain about this before, as it gives consumers the impression that the vehicle they like is available on the lot of the dealership whose website they're viewing."
3697,"To Mark or anyone who's driven the Q50:  Does the Q50 drive essentially the same as the G37 it replaced?  It has an improved interior and more tech., but has the same (aging and ubiquitous Nissan) engine.  Does it still exhibit the same characteristics, such as the overly intrusive boy-racer exhaust note, for example? (Some like it, some do not.)"
3698,I drove a fully loaded Q50S AWD.  I drove into the dealership in a 2011 FX35 -- I have test driven the M37X's and several other Infinitis within the past 4 months.
3699,"Maybe the reason the Q50 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all.   There's a review of the Q50 over on Left Lane News that is pretty positive in regards to the ""roar"" being a little tamer maybe due to sound proofing more than anything.  The quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit.  But in that comparo you referenced, they could have at least thrown in a G37x just for comparison purposes but maybe they figured they have done that show before."
3700,"No disrespect, but how is an Infiniti a drivers car? BMW and Audi yes."
3701,prob because its a performance car and the 2 extra lbs would slow it down.
3702,Agree with your assessment 100%.
3703,"""I think he might have said something about an adjustable suspension so they can make Lexus customers happier. """
3704,"Kirstie...I've seen that at dealerships before.  They show lots of stock.  You call them.  And, they say ""those units are on their way"".  In short, they list every car/model the manufacturer makes and give the impression they're in stock."
3705,They've always carried a lot of inventory of the lower priced models..
3706,"Puffinalong -- no disrespect taken.  And, I can't believe I am somehow seeming (even to myself) to be defending or at least suggesting the G37x, er Q50S(x) deserves to be compared with the Audi and the BMW."
3707,"While I love the comments and reviews I wonder what could actually be gained interms of a true review from a simple test drive that lasted 15mins in a controlled environment. I've been to a few apple stores, played around with a few gizmos and thought they were cool but is that a true review of those items?  The quotes Japanese bmw, The long post on the Audi discount I don't get- (audi club discount, really?) seems a bit drawn out and forced to prove some point which is never really given, is it a good or is it a tech driven value?  Or at the price point, like the g it really is 90% of Bmw driving and 110% Better in tech? I'm going to reserve my own thoughts on the q (ugly name) once I've driven it and once the experts have compared it to its true comp.  I would also note for real value seekers, if indeed there is a surplus of q50s on the lot and they are indeed good cars one could take advantage of such a mistake that someone else posted as infinitis fault at launch in lack of proper advertising."
3708,I urge you to take a test drive of the Q50S AWD -- which is pretty easy to do since there  appears to be NO RWD samples available (at least here in my part of the country).
3709,"Are getting to be standard equipment on commercial vehicles...  so, the insurance companies think they are useful."
3710,Let me narrow it down rather than making a blanket statement that all Rain-Sensing Wipers are ridiculous and useless....
3711,"I haven't had to parallel park here in Georgia in at least 10 years or more....I honestly can't remember ever doing it!  But when I visit my cousin in Los Angeles, I always end up parallel parking all the time (especially in Pasadena)!  She has an '08 Lexus GX470 and it side mirrors tilt down in Reverse along with the Backup Camera coming on and it's actually very handy.  If nothing else, it keeps me from curbing the chrome wheels!"
3712,"What a blanket statement and pretty silly too.  Do you have any proof of what you're saying?  I ran over a small Weber grill that my wife had conveniently placed right behind my car one time.  Could have been a small child and I was PAYING ATTENTION but absolutely could not see it in any of my three mirrors or by cranking my head around.  Just because you think you are perfect doesn't mean you could never make a mistake or see something right at your bumper.  Try placing something very short right behind your car and see if you can see it in your mirrors or by turning your head.  I think you'll see where a camera could be useful IN CONJUNCTION with mirrors, etc."
3713,"Oh, did the weber make it? Best grills on earth."
3714,I had something very similar happen except with a small child (no body was hurt).
3715,"Things happen, a back-up camera would have helped a lot in that situation.  I guess you must have been ""picking your nose"" if you know what I mean and have been following along."
3716,Crushed.  Poor Smokey Joe!
3717,"Hello Folks..Just came across a pre-owned 2013 328i deal. It has 21000 miles in ~1yr and it was sold to the dealer in a Manufacturer Vehicle Auction. It is Lux line+Prem Pack+Tech Pack+Cold weather pack+Lighting pack+Driver Assis Pack and the dealer has very good price tag on the vehicle. Any suggestions/experience with Manufacturer Vehicle? I really love the deal, however, I am not familiar with Manufacturer Vehicle handling..?? Are 21000miles/yr too much? Is it a good call to buy the vehicle..? Any suggestions would be appreciated..!! I'm California."
3718,"Are you sure that's what the dial does?  On our 3 it controls the sensitivity to the rain, not the speed of the intermittent sweep, I would be surprised if the dial on the CX-9 was different ( but am not saying it isn't since I don't know from personal experience like with the 3)."
3719,"maybe it's a tail-risk event that you hit a kid, but for me a few hundred dollars more is something i'd gladly pay for, even if they made it standard and embedded it in the price."
3720,"""if i'm spending mid 30s for a car, a few hundred bucks more ain't gonna matter."""
3721,Exactly!  I think it's ridiculous the average American spends mid 30's for an average new car.
3722,"""Exactly! I think it's ridiculous the average American spends mid 30's for an average new car"""
3723,"Biggest part of the ""few hundred"" thing comes becasue of leases/loans.  A few hundred is ""only"" a ""a few buck per month"".  At low interest rates, $1000 in price translates into around $20 per months on a 60 month loan and can be even less on a lease, especially if it is subsidized by inflated residual. I can hear that salesman saying ""you have 20 bucks, don't you?"
3724,"dino...couldn't agree more.  The subsidized financing is what allows manufacturers to sell more and more cars, which masking the price increases."
3725,I bought the same car ten years ago for 22800 out the door.
3726,"Secondly, ten years ago I bought a TL Type S brand spanking new for 29,050. Try buying a base TL for that today."
3727,Passats are also still very good buys.
3728,"$22,800 in 2003 is $28946 in 2013 dollars. The 13 has more space, is safer, better equipped and gets better mileage."
3729,I realize what the thread is about. What was said was-
3730,According to the Auto Dealers Association the average transactions as of Nov 2012 was right at $30k.  That is a not mid-thirties.
3731,No argument here.
3732,The S4 is far from an average car though
3733,"""A few hundred here, a few hundred there, pretty soon your over 30K average transaction price. """
3734,I know it's a bit off topic but could you give a short impression of your time with the new Impala?
3735,I'll admit that larger behemoth vehicles like Minivans and SUV's benefit more from back up cameras.
3736,"Benefit more maybe - but shouldn't it be standard equipment on all cars ? Honda accord has it standard, I know consumer reports wants it standard to all, seems like its more important than lane monitoring or even blindside system someone was hyping."
3737,The biggest feature my Acura TSX had that my BMW 328xi doesn't is a backup camera.  I miss it!
3738,Read an article this morning BMW is having issues getting oem parts to dealers because of a shortage on parts- this is tarnishing the brand overseas as customers with broken rigs can't get them fixed and BMW (overseas) not giving out loaners.  I remember something similar happened to Audi / Vw as they had failing coils in the turbo 4 - huge lines to get anything done even oil changes at dealerships as a result.
3739,"The parts shortage was created by the implementation of a new supply chain logistics IT system that started in 2009.  They are a year behind in implementing and it has affected their ability to manufacture parts on time.  Unfortunately, once the switch is thrown, it's not easy to turn back."
3740,but shouldn't it be standard equipment on all cars ?
3741,Sween- Are you going to swap the G35 for the Q?
3742,Yep you are right lets strip the abs and airbags out as well.
3743,Will watch reviews and access pricing.
3744,I find ABS and Airbags useful (although I've never had an airbag actually be used for me; knock on wood).
3745,Not the best responce I crosses shopped the accord vs s4 - 2 cars which are 30 grand apart at the start. Congrats on the s4 but the counter wow really.
3746,"Yes, they are nearly 30K apart; however I was cross shopping due to possibility of:"
3747,Are you really comparing a seat belt to a back up camera?
3748,You didn't pick up the sarcasm?
3749,"""ABS has been used countless times though; sometimes just for fun in an empty parking lot."""
3750,"Very true but ""Forced into a safety feature - did you also delete the seatbelt for the ""weight savings? """
3751,"for when you are forced to valet park. Valet parkers are always backing cars into spaces, and in a massive hurry. Helps prevent all kinds of annoying bumper dings."
3752,"Rear windows have gotten smaller and the rear decks much higher due to increased passenger safety regs for rear collision.  This had made the view out the back window much harder to see short objects(kids, dogs, fire hydrants, etc).  There are many kids killed each year due to people backing up vehicles hence the rear cameras.   Many people are looking at them like they are just convenience features like power windows.  They aren't, they are meant to save lives, not to preclude a ""ding"" to your bumper.  Weight?? Probably less than a lb. once you've already got the big screen for your nav or radio.   Stop eating fries for a week and you'll save that one pound a rear camera will cost you."
3753,Stop eating fries for a week and you'll save that one pound a rear camera will cost you
3754,I include myself in the comment about eating fries.
3755,"Unless the camera is wireless, I bet there's way more than one pound involved in adding a camera."
3756,$58 to $203 dollars in cost probably translates into $116 to $406 dollars in price.
3757,"I remember a few years ago, I think it was Mazda RX8, advertised their weight savings measures...such as drilled pedals."
3758,"Yeah. low voltage wire weighs a lot.  Are you for real?  A camera and mounting probably weighs half a lb. and the wire another half a pound or so.  Ok, maybe the whole thing weighs two lbs.  You're right, that would like cut .000001 off your 0-60 time."
3759,Just because there is a TV screen in the middle console doesn't mean I have to look at it.
3760,"You have hit rock bottom with the responses. Sorry man, this has ""leader ad"" defeat written all over it- you should do a little research on the benefits of rear camera, no one is saying they take the place of common sense driver but as an aid to save lives they cannot be ignored. - and as of now no one will force you to have one- but time will come like seatbelts and airbags where they will be mandatory in the states on new cars."
3761,I traded in a 2007 Explorer on a 2012 Mazda CX-9 last year.  The CX-9 came with a standard Rearview Backup Camera.  The Explorer had Rear Park Assist (Sonar) that would beep when it deetected an obstacle and the frequency of the beeps would increase as you got closer to it.
3762,"Kids are run over because the people backing up WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. Texting, putting on makeup, picking the nose, playing with the radio, what have you. What makes you think these people are going to be bothered to look at the backup camera?"
3763,"I did find it annoying the XXX number iS models from BMW are only available in Coupes, and those have the 320 HP or so your looking for right?  Why not have an IS version of the 335?  335is in sedan, not just coupe."
3764,"graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his 335i for around $600, I think.."
3765,"I think the ""is"" is available on coupe only because it is old E90 platform.  It used to be available on sedan as well, but they switched the platforms.  New 4-series won't have ""is"" trim just yet, either."
3766,"[i]graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his 335i for around $600, I think.."
3767,"""graphicguy had the dealer apply the performance engine update to his 335i for around $600, I think.."
3768,"It's been reported by  a couple of vendors that the 3l engine is making roughly 330hp, but I also think that BMW has always underrated their engines, my 330 with ""only 235hp"" was faster then some cars with 80 + HP.I'm sure the close ratio transmission had something to do with it."
3769,FN...nope.  Mine was the 335i with the performance pack (firmware) upgrade.  The 335is also had some minor suspension and wheel tweaks.
3770,"'I did find it annoying the XXX number iS models from BMW are only available in Coupes, and those have the 320 HP or so...'"
3771,You should have put a Dinan sticker on your rear deck. It adds 30 hp.
3772,It was actually the 370 TQ
3773,"When I bought my 330Ci, the model designation had already been removed from the trunk lid...     I gained 5 HP just from better aerodynamics!"
3774,"Yes, that's an often overlooked tweak!"
3775,Oh yeah... subbed in black grilles...    they soak up the heat and the engine warms up faster..  gets me 3 more MPG!!
3776,Oh boy! We'll be up to 400 hp and 40 MPG the rate we're going!
3777,"I was looking thru the inventory at a local BMW dealer and noticed something interesting.  Most of the 328i models in stock have either the Luxury Line, Sport Line or M Sport Package (which adds $2100-$3500 to the 328i base price).  Now that they have the 320i to fill in the entry-level slot, the 328i prices are climbing into the upper 40s and even topping the $50k mark...."
3778,"I'm considering a preowned 2012 or 2013, when I went to check it out, the USB doesn't recognize the ipod, I guess it needs a different cable like my audi.  Is this something easily installed or does the car have to already come equipped with the capbility?"
3779,"I didn't observe this trend here yet (majority 328 here don't have any ""line"" package, but there are very few 320i on lots), but it doesn't surprise me.  It seems logical."
3780,"""Oh boy! We'll be up to 400 hp and 40 MPG the rate we're going!"""
3781,"I've technically just ""ordered"" my custom equipped and colored S4 from Germany to the dealer I put $1,000 down at as a deposit/non-refundable payment."
3782,Observation and opinion -  don't see many 335 sedans up east (new one at least) did see one this weekend in Monaco blue? With the m sport pack and was not impressed by its looks one bit- older car looked way better similarly equipped.
3783,Our companies 45K mile Odyssey has a warped rotor shuttering issue; seems to be a problem with Honda Acura now that multiple have mentioned it.
3784,"It is Imperial Blue (dark) or Estoril Blue (Light), the latter is M-exclusive.  Monaco is an old dark blue color from several years ago, prior Deep Sea Blue, which is what I have.  All three (Monaco, Imperial, Deep Sea) are close."
3785,"I didn't opt for a rear backup camera on my next car, probably because it cost a lot more than $1.00; which is about all that feature is worth to me.  Okay, with line/lane guidance on the video, maybe $10.00."
3786,Get a go pro camera and mt to dash- plenty of Russian videos on you tube with bad drivers. I'd take a backup camera any day over lane guidance.
3787,"I'm with you -- backup cameras are quite helpful, as are sensors (f+r).  My wife's Infiniti has the ultimate, an around view monitor with both front and rear sensors and front and rear ""projection"" lines that turn with the steering wheel."
3788,"Mark, I in the last 3 months, I have had 4 infiniti's as rentals, 1 G37 sedan, 2 JX, and one whale (QX). The JX and QX's were all upgrades at no cost since National did not have the SUV I had reservation for. All three had a lot of options, they had the ""bird eye view"" which was pretty cool, it was a big help when driving the QX (The Whale.) The front and rear senors where helpful when back up as well as the rear view camera, the QX is HUGE!!!"
3789,You know what else is huge.. The money I saved by switching to geico.
3790,"ahhh, I misspoke and mis-wrote."
3791,Yeah those lines are useful for spots- I also like the general camera for watching and seeing kids - but that's just me I guess

3795,"You guys make some really good points.  Fed, don't know why, but I thought you lived near me.  Thanks for the input."
3796,"kyfdx....you have to incessantly stop by their showrooms to get these invites to the new car rollouts.  Of course, as Mark states, you also have to be willing to get a barrage of ""special offers"" once you attend one of those."
3797,"'They know there is an engine, because that's the part making noise...'"
3798,"As the prices of these ""new"" ELLPS keeps going up & their driving experiences (according to us car nuts) keeps diminishing, some of our favorite vehicles to discuss here will be coming off of their short term, blow out leases at prices in the mid $20K to low $30K.  As we all say, a lot of these cars are ""worn"" and not driven will still be under factory warranty as well as having some sort of CPO coverage.  Imagine the possibilities for the price of a fully loaded Camcord you could have a 326 hp G37X, a 335d with 425 lb/ft of torque, a C300 Sport 4Matic with an electronically controlled adaptive suspension, a TL SH-AWD with its torque vectoring rear differential...  All with what?  20 - 25K miles."
3799,heh...yes the 3 would probably win against the Mazda 6.
3800,"Is the 320i FWD?  I ask because I don't know.  If it's RWD, then I'd say it's got an advantage over the Mazda 6.  Probably a weight advantage since it's smaller too.  That being said, if I could get a brand new 335i for $45K that would be the way to go.  328i should be $35K well equipped."

3813,I do feel your pain -- my first (and only) new A8 spent more time (or it seemed that way) at the dealership than in my garage.
3814,"Thanks!  As much as my finances are thanking me a bit for having 3 months to prepare for this HUGE purchase (for my budget, was definitely stretching; but pre-owned S4's seem to be holding their value REALLY well, are popular fast sellers making them rare, and I didn't see the value in a lightly used one if it was going to cost nearly as much if not the same amount (given the usual 60K MSRP they are typically bought at)."
3815,"S4 Fancier leather option:  Hardest one to pony up for as it MSRP's at $1,250.  However, I noticed all the details it comes with from the fine Nappa Leather all round, to the contrasting stitching (in the color you choose) on the center armrest, shifter, steering wheel, seats, and door armrests.  I loved that level of attention and contrast.  Most importantly though, at least in the S5, they cut the Alcantara seam about 1/2 to 1"" too high on the upper seat section.  If you lean your upper seat back at all, you can see the vinyl mesh material where it meets the lower seat cushion.  In the S4, the Nappa leather was cut lower down, so even way leaned back, you couldn't' see the less desirable seat trim."

3823,"Benz has the same problems, or even worse.  Their leather is even more expensive and even fewer C-class cars have it.  The MB-Tex, or whatever it is called is a nice fake leather, so dealers order majority of those C250 and even C300, or C350 with those seats.  At least in case of 328 and 335, majority get premium package, which has leather.  Kind of sad.  I'm hoping that when the novelty wears off, which should be soon enough, in couple of years they'll start adding leather as one of those ""no cost options"", or at some lower price, call it ""value package"", or similar.  Something like that seems to be going on already in other areas, most cars get ""build credit"", which I'm not sure what it means, but smells to me like a simple cash rebate."
3824,"Well, it actually happened to a degree in the second half of E9x series.  They had number of accommodations, like no-cost automatic (it was $1000, IIRC when it started) and at the very end leather became complimentary no-cost option (part of value package).  This was last year or two, though, I think if I remember it correctly.  BTW, folding rear seat became standard on 328 and 335 (woohoo!).  It is still $500 option on 320."
3825,"The New Mercedes I was thinking of is the CLA which will be front wheel drive vehicle and priced at about $34K nicely equipped . I do not have anything against BMW other that their pricing model which is  is absolutely ridiculous. many of their models are indeed fun driving machines. However,  I would only buy one as a CPO with the idea of driving it for a few years or a killer lease,  Anyone who pays $35K and up for a 320i will be taking a bath later on. If I am looking at a premium brand, will take a TL , A G37, or a Lexus any day depending on on the kind of ride desire. Every time I have walk into a BMW to look at any of their SUV or Cars , I always walked away thinking how little you get for the money."
3826,"I don't think CLA is in direct competition with 3-series.  Doesn't mean people wouldn't cross shop them, of course, but those cars are quite apart, in size, price, target demographics. For price sensitive badge buyers, CLA will probably win.  For all I know, it may actually be a nice car.  BMW doesn't really have anything like CLA at the moment.  Going FWD by Benz is a sign of new times.  They get to build something cheaper and better fuel economy, all at once.  Unimaginable just 10 years ago, but with new nanny state, both here and in Old Continent.  Who knows, we may see FWD diesel S-class in a few years (wink)."
3827,"No, the CLA isn't in direct competition with the 3 series.  The new 1 series FWD will be the competition along with the A3."
3828,"THE CLA will be direct competition in the sense that it will be crossed shopped by the consumer. The consumers buying these cars do not care about the ""performance"" of the car other than being able to get ""the badge"" . They do not care and will probably not know the the differences between FWD and RWD. My mother in law drives a C250 and she has no clue whether her car is a FWD or RWD. She only cares about the fact that it is a Mercedes and she was able to get one for $35K. My wife has no clue that my old G37 was a RWD vs my curent FWD car.... She knows that I used to own an A6 and BMW530i and to her, my old G37 and current Acura are no longer in the same category. It does not matter both of these Germans cars were the most unreliable cars I ever owned. Fun to drive , Yes. Fun to own, NO. My mother in law, my wife, and my 27 year niece are the kind of  consumers they are looking for."
3829,"The entry point for BMW 3 series is $33K for a base 320i.  In Phoenix, the dealers have many 320's new, at $34K What is sad really is, BMW is trying to be like the other car companies who are trying to be like BMW.  We all know that BMW only imports the top level cars, why do we need leatherette, isn't cloth seats good enough? BMW success at balancing luxury with sport is the problem. People NOW expect leather, Nav, moonroofs, and all the elec gadgets in ""ELSP"" cars.  I wish BMW would drop the ""L"" in the ELSP and make their 320i a Entry Level Sport Sedan, drop the Premium package and add a true M sport package, with the E90 steering feel, have it with a manual or Auto. Forget Nav too.  But we all know BMW wont do it and people in their forum know that BMW wont do it. It seems people aren't willing to except the fact that the BMW that we all knew isn't the BMW of today."
3830,"There are German FWD cars on the market already, such as VW, Audi.  I understand what you mean about cross shopping, I even pointed that nobody can stop people from considering different products as similar.  I really meant to say 328 or 335 are not likely be in CLA competition, but you're right, 320 will probably be.  It might in fact kill 320, depending on how it drives and how it is equipped.  There will also be AWD version, as well, which makes it directly comparable to 320xi."
3831,"Did you mean accept? I did that comparison you mentioned, but just for the stuff that's common, such as engine, steering, console look, switches, etc.  Those don't change.  I'm not complaining about the fact they ordered leatherette, I am just noting that BMW does sell $40K+ car with such standard (yes, even 335 still has leather optional)."
3832,"robr2...you're probably right.  Call out is necessary here given it was actually a source that I read in passing, and not one that I recall.  Could have mis-read, or it could have been an ""anti-Lexus"" post with little cred."
3833,mrminsky...couldn't agree with you're assessment any more.
3834,"In July the one Cincinnati Infinti dealership had a ""special preview"" of the new Q50 -- they offered up finger foods, wine, soft drinks and a complimentary gift of Infiniti wine glasses and a Q50 key-ring that contained a USB drive with lots of free space to spare after the Q50 advert."
3835,"I got my license in 1979 and graduated HS in 1982 .. just as the whole ""yuppie mystique"" started. BMW's were always a brand I aspired to. Unfortunately, I've never been at a point where I could spend the money to buy or lease one."
3836,"The difference between a 320i and a Mazda6 is in the way it drives. I agree the 320i is overpriced, but the bottom line is - drive the Mazda and BMW back toback and you will see why BMW is still the one to beat."
3837,"It's not a FWD / RWD thing. It's the dynamics. BMWs have steadily drifted away from sport, but to drive one down the road you can still feel that German suspension doing its magic and the driveline refinement that no other sedan can match. BMW isnt what it used to be, but no other car rides/drives/handles like a BMW...still."
3838,"Dino, we all know that BMW wouldn't make a no frills sport sedan, there is no money in those, and I'm sure they wouldn't sell many of them. BMW has abandon the people who made them who they are today. That is why if you really want a 3 series that was fun to drive, you go back to the E46 as some of the BMW purist will say."

3847,"When I bought my 2012 Mazda CX-9 last year, the only trim level I considered was the top-level Grand Touring.  The 20"" wheels and chrome door handles totally change the look compared to the lesser models (and their 18"" wheels are hideous and look cheap).  It also had Mazda's BSM (Blind Spot Monitoring) system standard, but the very concept seemed ridiculous to me.  I expected to deactivate it and never give it another thought."
3848,"Excellent drivers check their blind spot, every time, no exceptions."
3849,Lexus IS 350 report.
3850,"Interesting discussion about safety nannies.  I bought a Volvo S60 last year with the tech package.  The only one I find annoying is the lane departure warning, so I have it turned off."
3851,Andres...thanks for the update.  You and I seem to have the same perceptions.
3852,"Although I had previously seen the ""Car & Driver"" set up of the three mirrors that adorn modern autos, I did a double check last night after work as I made myself and the car ready for my 20 mile commute home (up I71 North from downtown Cincinnati).  The set up of the mirrors and the driver's posture and seat position are very important to reducing (but as I came to find out, NOT eliminating) the blind spot. My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD advance comes with BSW.  I assume it is a radar like system, rather than a camera system."
3853,S60 would love to hear more about your experience with the car- don't see too many of them
3854,"Sween,"
3855,"I test drove a new 320i today. Plain Jane with auto tranny, engine idle-stop, and leather or vinyl - I couldn't tell."
3856,"fed.....thanks.  You're the first person I've heard from who has driven a 320i.  Matter of fact, I haven't seen one on the road yet.  Saw a couple at the BMW drive event, but no one was test driving them."
3857,"I actually had one last year as a rental when I was in Toronto for two weeks.  I always reserve a 'Premium' class vehicle since I travel for 2-3 days per week at least 36 weeks each year.  I'm a Commerical Insurance Premium Auditor and the audit expense is billed to the client as part of the contract.  Part of my contract with the Audit Firm I work for is that I only stay in at Hilton properties (Hampton or Hilton Garden Inn if possible), I fly busines class and whether I'm driving from home to the client of flying somewhere and renting a car, I can rent anthing I choose as long as it is within $25/day of what I would get for mileage reimbursement in my own car.  In reality, I get the Premium cars for a lot less than what I'm allowed!"
3858,"All BMWs are optioned way requested by the sales managers or customers, within model allotments, of course.  My guess for the reason of the oddball combination is that the dealer had some rigid price target in mind and grabbed options that fit that without really thinking if they made sense.  Perhaps that was also a reason the car landed in the rental lot, as they couldn't sell it retail."
3859,"I haven't seen one on the road yet either. The white one I drove (with manual seat that I thought was just fine) was at the BMW Drive Event I participated in. The event was poorly run so I only had time for the one drive, but the free BMW travel mug was a nice bit of swag."
3860,"Back in November 2005, I was shopping for new 2005 or 2006 Mazda 3 s 5-door.  It was introduced in 2004 and still a very hot seller when I started looking at them.  I wanted it in Gray or Silver, 5-speed manual, Power Moonroof AND without Black Leather interior.  In 2004 and 2005, Mazda didn&#146;t use trim levels (Sport, Touring, Grand Touring} so there was just a 2005 Mazda s 5-door with five major option packages- ABS/SAB (ABS & side airbags), Moonroof/6CD (self-explanatory), Xenon/TPMS (Xenon HID headlights & Tire Pressure Monitoring), Leather Package (Black was the only choice) and Navigation Package."
3861,"Good write up on the 320i.  Thx.  Still too rich for my blood.  Priced up a 320xi on the BMWUSA website with leatherette, metallic paint, Bi-Xenons, backup camera, & hot seats.  MSRP was north of $39K."
3862,"I agree.  It basically costs close to previous generation 328 with nice six-cylinder, better handling, better interior."
3863,For several reasons [ including those you state here ]
3864,Ditto.  Our 2007 X3 that we leased had leatherette & it looked as good the day we turned it in after 3 years & over 46K miles.
3865,"328 is the sweet spot for the 3 series, in my humble estimation.  I don't like the harshness of the 4 cyl turbo, though.  Power is good, as is the MPG, however."
3866,"Perhaps then it was somebody dragging something trully abrasive through these seats and left a mark.  Anyway, I don't really care for those in 40-50K car.  If not leather than a premium fabric (like microfiber) would actually be better, IMHO - but I'm sure it wouldn't sell.  Some (manye?) people buy those plastic leather immitations of leather for similar reason they would buy fake Rolex or Gucci, even if Timex or Casio would actually serve them better as time pieces."
3867,ok...I'm interested in the details
3868,"I do like the S4's looks, styling, and engineering.  Not too many buttons, I did get button overload in the TL SH-AWD and the center display behind the steering wheel was way too small for my tastes.  The Acura just goes nuts with buttons, and comes off as a ""TECHIE"" car to me, whereas the Audi comes off as an Engineer's driver's driver car."
3869,"On the S4 I think the lower rear end of the back bumper should be painted body color, but it isn't.  Works better with some colors moreso than others."
3870,"The dealer was running a special the last two weeks of July. I can use the 3/36 sercive maint.  at any Acura dealer in the country including theirs. It is issued through Fidelity and it was worth $657 (Steep). It basically covers an synthetic oil changes every 6K mile or six months as well as tire rotations. In addition, any other fluid changes needed during the first three years as well any general routine maint required during the first three years"
3871,Interesting idea to swap with my sister for a couple of weeks.  Not sure she'd go for it.  Not sure I want to.
3872,"Seriously, I feel envied with those who like the current Acura TL styling. The 2013 TL is an incredible deal but I just can't stand the styling (speaking from an owner who loved the 04-08 TL inside out)."
3873,OH NO....... I can't believe I made such a mistake.
3874,"I think his point was that if you like the looks of the TL, then you are lucky, because it's a great car (if, and that's a big if, you like the looks/styling.)"
3875,"I think he said he was envious of people who liked the styling of the TL ( like you) as he felt it is a great car ( and value) but for his taste he doesn't like the styling, but that he knows others do and he is happy for them.  I am sure he is happy for you, and you are obviously happy with your car which is great ( BTW the TL isn't to my tastes either, but unlike others I wouldn't go as far as to say it is ugly either, I think some details are not pleasing to me, but that doesn't mean I think anyone is stupid or unlucky to have bought one, it would be a very boring world if everyone like the same things)."
3876,"Audi does that ""styling cue"" tastefully and effectively.    However, have you seen a recent model GTI where half the entire back bumper is plastic cladding?  Looks terrible!"
3877,It looks just about the same size to me - lower 1/3 or so....
3878,I like the 2 color bumper of the Audi s4 - same as the bmw 3 m package cars- makes it stand out a bit - wish my GF had one.
3879,"While I know I'm late to the party, I had the opportunity to drive a 2013 G37 Sedan (non sport) a little bit last week while away on vacation.  Overall, I really liked it.  The power it puts out is incredible.  The G37 is one very fast machine.  It seemed very well matched to the 7 speed automatic which was always in the right gear & very willing to downshift.  Interior materials and fit & finish were first rate.  Steering was very direct although lighter than I prefer.  The ride was comfortable on its 55 series Good Years.  I like its cockpit feel.  Very nicely bolstered seats too.  I was really impressed by how much better the navigation system worked as compared to my BMW."
3880,"I said recent base model GTI, not current model top of the line trim GTI."
3881,Gotcha but you need to be a little more specific.  The car you reference is a MK5 from 2008...that's two generations ago.
3882,"Plus, leaving it one color would make the rear end look huge...it would go from an appealing J-Lo to an almost comedic Kardashian."
3883,"I don't know, the gray plastic just doesn't fool me.  The bumper is still the same size no matter if you paint it a rainbow of colors."
3884,"TL-SH AWD:  The transmission just feels like a traditional slush-box, slow and laggy.  I was told it does better in manual mode, but S mode did little to improve the average performance (typical automatic)."
3885,andres....I can't quarrel with any of your assessments.  Pretty much the same feelings I have.
3886,I think the entire LEXUS line up is comical (no insults intended).
3887,"Our 2011 FX35 is coming off lease -- and Infiniti has already tried to lure my wife into another Infiniti with an ""early out"" or ""pull ahead"" deal (you know where at least 3 months of the lease is forgiven, plus any miles over are wiped off the books.)  In the time frame where we switched from German to Japanese, the primary motivation was the super sub-vented lease deals offered by (at the time) Acura and Infiniti.  We've actually grown to have more than a modest amount of appreciation for the Infiniti and, truth be told, my '12 SH-AWD TL Advance Acura has certainly made me confident that its reputation for durability is probably well deserved."
3888,"As always, appreciate & enjoy your adventures"
3889,Here is one aspect of the bundling of features and options the automakers seem hell bent to force onto us:  the nearly autonomous capabilities some of the technology seems to imbue these cars with comes at a huge cost ($ cost.)
3890,Seems like a long post for one option- my opinion which means zero - you can get a 50k q50 with bsw - I'm sure at that price point one would get a boatload more car then an 51k A6 with BSW. (Again I've not done the apples to apples research)
3891,"Yes, a long post if the entire spirit of what I was ""on about"" was a single feature -- my peeve is with the concept of being able to choose to select a set of features or to customize.  I am fine with the concept of discounting if a bundle is selected.  Yet, there are customers who would upgrade and add X option but are discouraged from doing so by virtue of the bundling cost."
3892,"I hear what you are saying and it makes sense about the full packaged car with expandable options, even after you leave the lot. (Would like to see the software program that includes wheel and tire, sunroof, seats, suspension and other items thou).  The car makers will learn a lot about what tesla is doing with its customizable options and production line efficiency. Bsw seems like a good idea to be standard - but I wouldn't use it."
3893,"At the risk of raising the ire of the moderator, I am wondering, not critically, why you wouldn't use BSW? To underscore the point, I would assume you don't stick your arm out the window to indicate you are turning -- you flick the turn signal stalk, yes?"
3894,"No offense but I think I'm a good enuf driver and constantly scan my mirrors and understand my driving position at all times on the road. I'm not saying its not a useful tool certainly to people who are preoccupied by other driving features not we all are saddled with. I've used the lane system thing in a m35 a few years ago for a week when I swaped cars with a co worker- I found myself looking to shut it off every time I started the car. I like technology but do we need cars that drive itself like the new q50? I can count the lawsuits.  I can see its benefits but I wouldn't equate it to seatbelts, break lights or blinkers (or even slipmanagement systems)."
3895,"Sweeny if your comment was right, then BMW, Audi and MB would be lowering their prices, that isn't happening. There will always be the one who have a beer budget but want to live the champagne lifestyle. There are plenty of people out there that can afford the price of entry into a 335i.  If inifiniti was so successful in the ELPS why did they abandon the all might G37 for the new (really dumb name) Q50? If price really matters then wouldn't infiniti have stayed with the G37?"
3896,Back in the flight zone- Infiniti costs less then Audi and BMW because they are not Audi and BMW - if they had the cashe the would up prices- so they (lex and others included) have to undercut to get sales.
3897,"Don't know if it's a harbinger of what's to come, but I received an ad from an Infiniti dealer yesterday.  Apparently the Q50s have just hit their lot and they're already offering a $1,250 discount."
3898,Don't think Infiniti is trying to be BMW...Why would they want the stigma of being the lux car that you have to trade in or sell before 50k miles due to its inferior reliability and higher maintenance cost. I am sure Infiniti owners don't rush to sell at 50k. Just sayin'
3899,"We all have our opinion now don't we, but if people lease cars for 3 yrs and have 12K/yr then those cars would have less then 50K on them. Not too sure if there is a correlation between when a lease ends and the 50K you mention."
3900,I've been cross shopping these 2 models.
3901,"Reviving this a little because I just bought a TL Special Edition after leasing a 2010 G37 Sedan..... I am aware of Acura highly discounting the vehicle because of the lack of sales and appeal. The TL is a gift for what is being sold for when comparing it  to the competition and as  wise of a consumer that I am , I happily bought one after comparing all the others.  I remember hating the 2009 version when it first came out. Yet, I think they did a great job with the latest model. I think the car is extremely attractive and if anything, it is different to all the cars on the road. Everyhing else  look like Sonatas to me. Seriously, I can't tell the difference between a new Sonata and everything else out there. The Lexus ES350 and the GS350 look the same and they look like Sonatas. The Sonata and the Azera look the same. The new Q50 looks like a Sonata from behind. The Mazda 6 looks like a Fusion which looks like a Sonata except for the front grill.  All the Buicks look alike and they all look like  Sonatas.  With the exception of Cadillac and BMW, everything else look like Sonatas"
3902,"Hate to admit - and I'm a g fan- they want to be bmw- all the cars on the list want to be. Bmw is the best at rolling people into underpowered automatic 328 at nice lease prices - then higher hp lower priced Japanese and American rivals- then selling those underpowered and less tech savy used cars as cpo because they were all serviced under the ""free"" oil change program. It's a great model to follow and Infiniti Lexus and the like wish they had it so good like the German standards."
3903,"Owned a 5 series and traded it at 45K miles. Owned an A6 and traded it at 47K miles. Took the new  BMW328 on a test drive and it has to be the most overpriced car on earth. Every time I came to a stop, the car would shut off. WHAT? $46K WHAT?  The G is a better car that any of these 3 series (old and new)  when you account for the overall package and reliability. I am sure the Q50 will be too. I will take a Q50 over the 328 any day."
3904,"So every time I get into my car I have to disable this? No thank you..... More importantly, the sudden rattle or shaking once the engine started was enough for me to disapprove of the car.  This is the reason I liked my old G and my Current TL, both cars offer enough technology but not overwhelming enough to take over the pure pleasure of driving a car."
3905,"According to Automobile Magazine """
3906,"andres3....tough choice.  I truly love the S4.  It's not been ""bullet-proof"", however.  It spends some time at the dealer for one thing or another about every other month.  Some of the things Audi just can't seem to fix (hiccups in the MMI/B&O audio system is something that's a continued to be troublesome).  My Quattro system is binding at slow speeds.  They're working on that now (awaiting parts from Germany).  There have been several other issues, too."
3907,"On year 6 and 35k miles on my g- been only for oil changes and one set of pads. Something to be said for Japanese sudo lux cars without the ""free oil change"" plan.  I don't care if the loaners are Porsches it gets old quick."
3908,What I've seen from driving TL-SH AWD and looking at the S4 (and knowing it's performance figures).
3909,"My '06 A3 has nearly 103,000 miles and has been very reliable.  I'm also in no hurry to get rid of it, or in any hurry to sell it.  I can take my time."
3910,"You paid an extra 4500 for the same engine - older car from a luxury division that has an extra year warrantee and a better stereo. The 4500 you spend will never be realized in trade or sale- - if so please show me the math- that same 4500 should if bought correctly should be a lot tighter because we all know Acrua is not selling any (non-mdx) cars for anywhere close to sticker. Honda on the other hand depending on market is getting a lot closer to sticker then big brother. Free maintence is huge ask any bmw owner- agreed but given the accords background doubt you would need more then a couple of oil changes. Name looks- really- you and billy are prob the only 2 people who actually believe the TL is attractive, that and the ""people"" he seems to talk about that give him compliments.  :sick:  with all that being said I do think the TL is a better overall value then any A4. Good day"
3911,"The msrp the TL was closer to $9000 higher than the Accord. Have you seen the TL SE with some of the nice extras including the leather, wheels, etc?. So yes to me, the premium was worth it. But this is the same question we have been asking for years."
3912,"Absolutely agree with you that there is usually a lot more than meets the eye in the differences between the ""luxury"" version and the ""regular"" version.  When people say the A3 is a GTI with a nicer interior I laugh.  There were and are real suspension tuning, sound insulation, quality (paint, fit/finish, QC for less issues) that made them far different.  And for me the interior was a wide margin apart that the premium was worth it (also longer warranty and free maintenance back in '06)."
3913,$32K is a great deal by the way for the Base TL FWD.  What would you figure an equivalent deal is for adding SH-AWD and TECH.  Looks like that would add $7K at least unfortunately from the quotes I'm getting.
3914,"The Extra Year of warranty and the Overall dealer experience is better and worth something. The Acura might not have the cache that Lexus, BMW, or Mercedes might be , but it is still an entry luxury badge with a little extra to boost."
3915,andres3...sounds like you really like the S4.  They're great cars.  Go for it.  I will say that the Audi S/C 3.0 is WAAAAAYY UNDER RATED.  My guess is it puts out closer to 350+ instead of the ~330HP they advertise.
3916,"Not impressed with what BMW has been doing as of late with some of these cars for the premium they get. I love their styling and I always have, but their newer 4 cyl have a lot to be desired. Their reliability has been horrendous with their turbos.  You either love them or you hate them..."
3917,"Graphicguy, your experiences mirror my somewhat dated ones."
3918,"At least I said where I got it from and I'm pretty sure anybody that follows the industry at all will verify that the margins are better on suvs/cuvs and trucks then they are on passenger cars unless you're talking about megabuck cars like Ferrari, Bentley etc....which we aren't."
3919,"so a decline in sales over a period of 6 years (and giving more discounts then its comps) is a good thing for profits and brand?   just like the SUV statement you made, Honda as a corporation does not break out margins by product line or atleast ive never seen it, or dont know where to get it, either do you it seems.. so my Opinion (i said it) was an educated one given the data provided."

3927,"Bored on a flight Wed night, was playing on the net and saw that BMW loaded the 4 series, the 328d and GT.  One interesting note, the EPA has not released it's MPG figures for the 328d, I'm sure BMW will be doing a big media blitz once they are.  I like the GT, however, the price is steep."
3928,I saw an ad for the 328d recently. Dont remember where but I do remember it saying 45 MPG highway.
3929,"BMW website had been posting that figure for a while, however, it has been taken down.  I believe it was also posted on Bimmerfest too."

3932,"FN...I don't think there's an issue with the mechanicals of the 4 series, it's more the style of it, which some have mentioned differ quite a bit from the car that was shown at the auto circuits."
3933,0&#150;30 MPH	           1.8 sec	  2.1 sec	   2.0 sec
3934,Didn't really get down to the numbers - I think in the real word a lot would have to do more with $$$ then anything else. Most Lexi and BMW would leave the show room in lesser engine form due to current lease rates - I thought the article was unique because bmw lost.
3935,"The people looking at this cars, aren't going to sweat the $$ much.  BTW, BMW lost by 1 point, not much of a different really."
3936,Ray
3937,Agree - boo -
3938,"Ray, infiniti is trying their best be like BMW..."
3939,Yes they have been trying to mimic BMW for some time now flight- that's why when you mention no one looking at these cars care about pricing -  you are wrong. Price matters -
3940,"The article you cut pasted did not say Honda actually got the money and secondly what is 5 million compared to 50 million. Lastly, you are cut and pasting information that you dont even understand, look at the revenues that HONDA is genarating-the same number you cut and paste. Go find out the their outstanding debt and probably that will paint a better picture of where they actually stand financially."
3941,And some have nothing to say about cars but simply to critique others.
3942,billy we are talking billions not millions- lastly both tm and hM got govt subsidies that ended in 2012 as well.
3943,Let's just say you weren't the target demographic.
3944,"so just to confirm no ""big profit"" data availible- ok thanks- ill stick with the sales and pricing data as more of a guide because atleast its in print and not an opinion"
3945,ok I am out.
3946,This sounds like a very nice package.
3947,Btw hmc on a chart does look interesting.
3948,"You can build a Q50 on the Infiniti site under Future Vehicles.  The Hybrid AWD is $46,405 but there are 2 option packages (Nav and Tech) that take it to $52,805 including destination.  The Sport version is another $2,400 to $55,205."
3949,I passed on the generation TL you are driving because I thought Acura didnt do anything special from the 2nd generation. The car was still FWD with the horrific torque steer and the styling was just too on par with the Camry's and the Accords(no insults intended just my opinion). I had the 2nd generation Type S and talk about torque steer and horrible in the snow. When they did the mid year refresh with the Type S I was even more disappointed- talking about more Torque steer and horriblw wheels. The current generation sh-awd is worlds apart in driving dynamics to 3rd generation and I never been told that the car is ugly in almost four years of ownership.
3950,"Sales flop or not, I've got a thing for the current generation TL (in SH AWD guise).  I personally don't like ""the beak"" of the 2009 - 2011 MY, but think the rest of the car looks fantastic.  The wheels, the faux quad tail pipes are 2 styling points that really ""make"" the car."
3951,"Not following any news on the upcoming TL- Dont know if I want another but thats still up in the air. They have to wow me- beefing up low end torque, over 340 HP and formula 1 performance and handling"
3952,"I'm going to purchase my next vehicle.  Once the lease is up on my BMW, I want off of the ""leasing hamster wheel."""
3953,"With only 24K on your odometer (what year is your car again?), you really don't need a new car unless you want to buy one.  Like you said, you need to be ""wowed"" because you do seem to be very happy with your current ride."
3954,"Hey Bill the numbers that Sweeny quoted, were they HMC, that included the motorcycle and motorsport division or just the car divisions (when I say Car's I'm talking Honda and Acura) ?"
3955,For anyone interested - the brochure is online - here:
3956,"nyc....billy....I mentioned that I just helped my sister buy a TL SH AWD Advance.  I had forgotten how really GOOD they are.  It seems Acura made some running engineering changes along the way that most wouldn't detect, unless you had an earlier model to compare it to.  Given that you can buy one at a decent discount, it would be hard to be in the near luxury market and not seriously consider one."
3957,ray....thanks for the post.  I had forgotten about the IS (maybe that's why Lexus is moving more towards Audi/BMW/Mercedes turf).
3958,"HMC numbers included all aspects of the biz, farm machines to jet planes. Its tough to get a clean balance sheet on a corporation without using all product lines."
3959,"sweendogy...you said I was mocking you.  Not intentional, just handing out some of the same medicine you do.  I actually agree with you about 90% of the time.  Just didn't make sense this time.  Cheers."
3960,"Total MSRP*$55,205- wow thats pricy actually- i also went to the site on the sport model if you want just nav you have to select tech as well - package increased by 4k or so - NO thanks- i'll wait until the reviews come out and the true market pricing levels are established- I hope they allow the tech to be a standalone option at some pt."
3961,Car is a 2009 and its a purchase-8/17/09.
3962,"medicine not needed- again sales numbers tell a story- if a car is selling 50% less then they did 6 years ago its clearly not doing well. Plus throw in the avg selling price on such cars is lower then prime comp. Perfect sense to me.  (both were backed up with fact, not opinion)"
3963,"You made a presumption that because the TL is heavily discounted that Acura, as a brand, was making little, if any, profit.  I agree that they are taking a bath on the TL right now for many reasons probably none of which indicate that it is a bad car(not pretty but not bad).  But, to extrapulate that out to state that the brand is not profitable is not fact...it is opinion or at best a WAG."
3964,is it my opionion thats based on sales of not just ONE car but 3 sedans and a ZDX.or 4 of 6 total products they produced in 2012.
3965,"Well, the operable word in your counter argument is ""probably"".  Which means a guess.  I have no idea if Acura can still make money selling the TL well below invoice.  My guess would be that they aren't doing much better than breaking even on it but making it up in other areas or models.  But that is a presumption in itself.  Nothing wrong with a presumption, opinion or guess as long as someone doesn't try to pawn if off as something that everyone should accept as fact."
3966,"Guys while I think the new q50 ( hate the name ) is going to be better then anything else in the segment for the price. Sure audis have nice interior, bmw has had the ""free service"" the bloodline and the cool codes for models, the Lexus has the nice show rooms and the lux background, the TL of late has had the discounts, the MB, cts, Volvo and Tsx have been outclassed at most levels."
3967,"I've been helping my mom's best friend shop for a new vehicle to replace her leased 2010 Infiniti G37.  Her lease expires on July 10th, so we're down to just a few weeks."
3968,"There is a forum (On edmunds) just for this, that talks about leases for all cars, find them for both the TL and G and see what people are leasing these cars for. This Forum is more about talking about these cars than best lease prices."
3969,You can do a Volvo S60 T5 for that money.
3970,"speaking of volvo s60- they sold more of them (last month, May sales) then honda sold Tl's and TSXs--"
3971,Thanks for the link sween.  It was an interesting read.  I didn't realize MB sells as many Cs as BMW sells 3s.
3972,"Good post ""igozoomzoom."""
3973,"The RDX is selling very, very well and the MDX is still a very good seller.  Guess which models Acura makes more profit on?  So sales of certain models doesn't necessarily spell disaster as it's overall profit that counts.  Of course making good proift on all your lines is preferable but as long as you're making money it's not exactly like you're going to go out of business.  Accords didn't so so well over the past 5 years but several other models like the CRX, Odyssey, Civic and Pilot sold well and with good profit margins."
3974,"the new MDX came out this week.  All new design.  Basically a ""supersized"" RDX, with the hi-tech AWD, etc.  But same basic platform and drivetrain, just more goodies and room."
3975,"While I agree the mdx (and its now a new mdx) and rdx sell well, very well they do not sell in numbers to keep the brand alone- look at the sales numbers for every other car they produce and they are mid pack at best in terms of sales- mind you mid pack means massive discounts and minimal If any profit.  Honda on the other hand no matter how bad the previous accord and  civic looked they stll were near the top of the sales chain. I would also note that when the last civic was being slammed they quickly fixed it because its the real bread and butter of the brand."
3976,"M6user, why even go the distant in debating someone who looks at one side of the Balance Sheet."
3977,"well M6 - i am the champion for research or atleast I do want a base for strong commentary as opposed to random thoughts.. case in point- the 2013 TL SHAWD with tech pack, we can mosltly agree would be a good example to use- it has a MSRP of over 44k, invoice of 41,6 and according to true car for my area (use 02144) you can get it for 39,588 (3 dealers willing to do this deal) - thats over a 10% discount- the BMW 328 is down 4%, the Audi down 6 and ATS Caddy is 3%.. i just dropped some knowledge on you.  I understand you cannot truly tell what they are making or losing on these cars but it tells you something when it comes to discounting and fact is they are not making as much (could be losing?) as they would like given the above figures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             second paragraph above- Again as i stated the 2 SUVS sell well, but lets remember how many MDXs are they selling?? 50k last year mdx - very good year -vs the x5s 44,445- the rdx 29,520 again very good year as they avg around 15k since inception the bmw x3 35,173[. BMW sells 100k 3 series in the states vs the tls 33k -- so are they really beating them by that much to justify a TL that sells a third of the 3 series?? lets add in the tsx 28,865 sales from 2012.. so 2 car lines make up HALF of 3 series sales. Acura no longer sells (haha) the ZDX-- they sold 379 RL for 2012. 379 wonder what the margins on the balance sheet on that one are (was).  (all numbers above are US numbers)."
3978,"My prior ride was an 2005 Abyss Blue Acura TL.  Other than not so good in the snow (until I bought it snow shoes), what a great all around ride!  Simple, handsome exterior, I still think it looks good.  Power, handling, good ride, decent mpg, nice interior, well built and reliable.  6.5 years, 85,000 trouble free, Zaino-shiny miles."
3979,"This isn't the forum to talk lease price's, this is to talk about the cars. The other forums will give you what people are getting the cars for. I found the RDX forum very handy for my cousin, he was able to get a great deal on one, from the posting on the  correct Forum."
3980,"oh billy billy billy-- billyboy wow - blaming buick, a division of GM for its management faults (& labor issues) and not the actual cars they produce..Seems fair-- oh wait honda didnt ask for a bailout in 09 are you sure billy?/"
3981,Answer these questions and try to analyze where the company stands-
3982,"Oh I wish I had time to pop some popcorn and watch this, however, I need to go pay some bills."
3983,i can run those numbers asap if needed- but i never said honda- i said acura.. hello
3984,Does it really shock you that a 6 yr old design(and which wasn't liked well in the first place) is being heavily discounted with the knowledge that the car is basically going to be discontinued?  You really need to take things in context.  Facts and statistics are useless without context and relativity.  You're right about one thing....they do need a midlevel sedan with great looks which may or may not be the new TLX.
3985,"Dont want to get into this kiddy talk but from the numbers you cut and paste, what is your deductive reasoning on how the company (Honda/Acura) is doing? Build a model and let me know."
3986,"billy - i've done enuf of the kiddy talk, the numbers I cut and past are the numbers you requested so... why dont you present a case and do some research.. like the article above that stated HMC took GOVT money- but you have yet to respond to that, its almost like you just said it to say it, which i guess is ok but I would like to know the true facts, which i supplied.  This is a car chat while I can run thru the business side of this I can also show facts about car sales and trends, car rag articles that dispute M3s claim it a One Car fix, which I have."
3987,"Does anyone know when the recently announced 2013 Acura TL 'Special Edition' will actually be available?  The Press Release introducing the car was 6/07/13, which was one week ago."
3988,I'm sure it doesn't drive that much dif then the normal edition so maybe drive the normal one.  Interesting they are releasing a 2013 special at the end of June-
3989,"Hey Fed, the German wont import the smaller Diesels here, because of the American mentally of more is better. So they will import the top diesel engine."
3990,Euros pay a lot less in tax if they stay under certain engine displacement.  No such tax breaks in the U.S.
3991,"I wouldn't call those breaks.  If anything, these are penalties for personal vehicles with engines 2.0 l or more.  It's not on just the taxes but also insurance rates that are based on the engine displacement.  Both 2 liter is a magic number."
3992,"Whatever.  Point is the Euros pay less if they keep their engine size small.  No such ""incentive"" here.  That and the price of fuel is also additional incentive to go with small displacement and accompanying higher MPG."
3993,"That's right. Bottom line, Europeans use small engines not because they like the, but because their government told them to."
3994,"Dino, your right the 2 L is the magic number and MB has a 2.1L diesel that is one of their big work horses, which is being imported to the US."
3995,"Exactly, and given the same scenario that we have in U.S. the Euros would also be driving bigger cars with bigger engines.  Some would have you believe it is just one big character fault of Americans.  It's not a matter of natural enlightenment."
3996,I dont think anyone claims it's a character fault of Americans or a matter of European enlightenment. The presence of highly regarded tuner companies overseas speaks to the same desire for more speed/performance.
3997,That's why I said
3998,"Semantics, really, and I do see your point, but Im not sure I completely agree with you. There are, after all, many Americans who choose to drive smaller cars because they are more fun, handle better, or whatever other reasons."
3999,"No, i think we agree in general and that's pretty much what I'm talking about.....in general and we are talking somewhat historically here.  The scenario regarding gas prices in this country has changed greatly during the past 5 years so going forward a lot of smaller choices are going to made.  There are always exceptions to any rule and different degrees of difference.  But, again and in general, I think Americas love affair with big HP and big cars stemmed from the vast size and open spaces that were available when the auto came into being in this country.  The scenario you describe(narrow roads, congestion, short  travel distances and eventually high fuel prices) for Europe was like that for years and years before the auto made it debut."
4000,"So this begs the question, before the automobile did Europeans ride smaller horses?"
4001,"I agree with your previous statement.  Many people often insinuate the Europeans drive those small cars with small engines because they are such caring creatures and Americans love their obscenely huge cars with insanely large engines because they are such fill the blank.  I do believe there is large amount of excess and waste in so-called American way of life.  However, I also believe everybody else in the world would have done the same if given a chance."
4002,"I know quite a few Europeans who either own American muscle cars (at no small expense to buy, import and operate in Europe), or prefer larger Jags and BMWs as their preferred daily drivers."
4003,"There's not just a financial incentive for owning a small car in Europe.  If you've ever driven in a fairly large European city, you know that parking can be an absolute nightmare.  Finding a parking place for even a midsize sedan can be a challenge, but you can often find on-street parallel parking that you can squeeze a tiny car into.  I had a Nissan Micra when I was in the London area a few years ago, which was awful on motorways (drive to Newcastle = not fun), not great on ""a""' roads, but great for tight parking spots and tiny ""b"" roads."
4004,"True, parking spaces are smaller.  Even turn radii in places like parking garages can be just insane.  I remember one in Cologne - there was a post in the middle of exit curve with a rainbow of colors from paint transfers."
4005,"I used to drive in Manchester quite a bit.  Not only is parking crazy, they park any way they want, wrong side, pointed the wrong direction.  Of course, I saw quite a few fender benders as a result."
4006,"Those of us in the U.S. can't find the financial value equation to support diesels.  Plus, we like high revving motors.  Diesels do have good low end torque, but run out of steam quickly.  They'll never be more than a small niche here.  Hybrids, plug-in hybrids, clean gas engines do as well, mostly better than diesels."
4007,"I forget who, but someone wrote an article recently saying that the Electric car was just about dead, and for certain a dead-end technology we've sunk billions into and made little progress in the last couple of decades."
4008,"Yesterday, our local Infiniti store had a ""party"" of sorts for the 2014 Q50.  Food, drink, customized wine glasses and a 4MB thumb drive key-chain were the ""Thanks for coming"" gifts offered to this -- public invited -- coming out party for the new Q50."
4009,"Good to hear from you, Mark."
4010,Nice to hear from you mark as always!
4011,"Dealer rep tells me:  Q50's (AWD only unless special ordered with a customer's name attached) will be ""available"" on or about July 25th.  Oh, OK?"
4012,Mark correct me if I am wrong.
4013,"Thanks, Mark.  Interesting take.  Like Billy, I'd like to know if the engine/trans is the sae as the G37."
4014,"I have read ALL of the car magazines regarding the engine (3.7L) and the transmission (7spd auto ONLY, manual dropped altogether)."
4015,"Yes, wow.  At least that makes sense.  Not the price, it's outrageous, of course, but given who buys these, it's people who are much more particular and simply can afford it.  No $399 per month crowd, no leader ads, rather you see most conveniences, some sport or appearance stuff, too.  Unfortunately, BMW charges arm and leg, but they can, cause nobody else sells those, so you got to pay what they ask."
4016,2 had the m sport pack and all the other goodies - except manual -
4017,Sounds right.  The manual is no longer available with wagon.
4018,"I was challenged here some time ago to produce evidence of modern diesel needing more maintenance.  At the time I could  not produce it, although I heard that assertion multiple times from people who know more about cars than I do.  Now I have it - BMW will pay for its gasoline engines oil changes every 15K/2 years, while for its new diesel (328d) the period is 10K/1 year.  That is tangible evidence that modern diesel engine requires more attention.  Oil change is usually just a tip of the iceberg.  I'm reasonably confident there is more.   Nothing comes free.  Diesel engines used to be very insensitive to fuel, now they are very sensitive (due to clean diesel), which mean any kind of impurities will adversely affect durability and service - in turn I'll expect more extensive work required to keep them up.  It's all exact opposite to what's used to be.  Old diesels were clunky, noisy, stinky and slow, but super durable and resistant to abuse.  Many were naturally aspirated.  Modern diesels are quiter, smoother, faster, all are turbocharged.  As and engineer, I can say with some authority, there was a price somewhere.  I'm guessing (just a man's opinion) it will be in lifespan and service.  I'd not be surprised if their useful life came close to their gasoline counterparts and milion milers were things of the past."
4019,"It's not just Honda all of the Asian manufactures have it, even the Koreans.  Since Lexus is so successful in the luxury and they do not offer a ordering system foe customers how long do you think the Europeans will offer it?"
4020,If BMW is offering 4yr/50K free  maintenance then what is the problem? I would suspect that owners of a 328d would follow manufactures recommendations on oil changes once the 4/50 is over with. Whether it is 5K miles or 7500 miles.  Since there is no info on this as of yet.
4021,"To the kingdom come - well perhaps at least in forseable future.  It's completely different mindset.  They do that anyway for their domestic markets - almost nobody buys BMW or Benz from a dealer's lot over there.  The only reason for them to depart from that mindset is if they want to increase volumes and drop the price even further.  Right now BMW's price sheet in the US market is about 5 pages for each model.  In Germany it is a 50 page book.  Three, soon four engine versions here for (non-M) sedan, nine version there (four gasoline: 316i, 320i, 328i, 335i, five diesel:316d, 318d, 320d, 325d, 330d) and that's just a start.  They sell a lot more a'la carte options than here.  Germans joke that base Mercedes or BMW doesn't even have a side mirror, because it comes in so many options."
4022,"The problem is post ""free"" period.  Some people keep their cars longer than three years.  The allure of diesels has always been their long life.  If you trade every three years, of course no problem for you, just the next guy."
4023,Doesn't the payback for the extra upfront cost and small premium for a gal of diesel come after the 3-4 year period?  What would be the incentive for diesel if you are leasing it for 3 years unless you just like the smell?  It's not as if you see a lot 328s pulling trailers where you would need the torque.
4024,"Don't ask me, I'm not the one yearning for diesel."
4025,"yeah, there are a lot of WAGs, though educated, in your scenario.  There are many, many gas powered engines routinely lasting 150 to 200k without major trouble.  Usually, after so many years it is the other systems that start to add up to major dollars and headaches that incent many people to get rid of the vehicle and not the engine.  Just read about the Volvo owner that owns the world mileage record....2.7million miles on a gas engine.  Rebuilt twice.  Engines will last a long time if maintained very well.  A/C, auto trans, fancy electronics, etc. not so much."
4026,"I was mostly referring to things like NAV, radar cruise, lane positioning systems, etc etc.  but realize there are electronics on both the gas and diesel engines as well.   To what more of a degree they may be on a diesel I really have no clue."
4027,"Yeah, I don't know that either, what I know it is much more than ol' good diesel of the past.  I suspect it may be more than gas for one reason  - due to the nature of fuel burning in diesel chamber (much higher pressures), the ability to control that burning clean may require much heavier computer involvement - but that's again my guess.  It is based on how big of a deal it was to introduce ULSD fuel.  The resistance was not just because of the fuel cost, but because of the additional cost of the engines (which probably comes from electronics) and the fact that lack of sulphur is supposedly damaging to old engines.  Something to do with lubrication, don't know the details.  There must be heavy electronics in that thing to run so smooth vs. old diesels."
4028,"From automobile mag about the glk250 blue mentioned above ""it will surely not sell in big numbers: diesels account for just six percent of all new Mercedes sales in the U.S."""
4029,"""Very well"" is always a matter of expectations.  If they think they'll sell 10 and they sell 20, it's better than ""very well"".  Nothing is more effective in creating a buzz than shortage, artificial or real.  That's especially true in low-volume models, when the demand can unexpectedly turn higher than expected and can't be satisfied due to low production, which was due to marketing team telling their bosses they won't sell many, not necessarily because of some evil plan. I'd like to see how many total GLK were sold and how many of those were diesels - moreover, how many did MB actually expect to sell."
4030,"Edmunds used to have ""Future models"" tab with comprehensive brand-by-brand view on up-to-date knowledge on future models.  It seems gone, replaced by generic automotive news column that's unsorted.  It sucks."
4031,"My thoughts are that unless you are a cab driver or someone who drives a lot more than the 20,000 miles per year that I drive, it is extremely difficult to justify the purchase of a diesel or hybrid vehicle purely for the ""gas savings."""
4032,"My understanding is urea tank is not universal (e.g. VW don't have it and BMWs are not expected to have it), but the rest is true.  We also have diesel price higher than premium gas here in Tampa, sometimes as much as 10%, it is seasonal.  It never goes even close to regular gas range, which means a decent regular gas four cylinder Honda/Toyota is really way to go for somebody focused on economy.  This being ELLPS forum, focusing on fuel economy, especially through diesel technology, seems slightly out of place."
4033,"You are correct that ""gas savings"", inferred as $ savings,  is not a wise financial plan for most individuals when deciding to purchase a diesel."
4034,Interesting article today on cars.com blog about diesel maint costs.
4035,"Interesting - I didn't know Passat's TDI has urea tank.  That makes no sense to me.  If Jetta doesn't, why would Passat?  On surface it looks like same engine (2.0 l diesel).  Beats me.  Every day learn something new."
4036,"Government data, over on the Diesel forum someone post the sales number of the GLK250s they are selling better than what MB had expected. The GLK250 are less then the GLK350 and get roughly 50% better mileage."
4037,"The problem is North Americas ""thirst"" for horsepower. I think deisels make a lot more sense economically and environmentally when you look at the little 1.6L motors they use in Europe."
4038,Love to see the numbers as this car only hit dealerships at the end of April and would be surprised the may monthly have been released yet.  But if you are trying to say that diesel and hybrid car sales are surpassing overall us market growth rate you would have a legit point.
4039,"A reporter would like to speak to a car buyer who refused to buy a vehicle because premium fuel was required/recommended by the manufacturer. If you did not purchase a car after discovering premium fuel was required/recommended, and instead purchased a car that requires regular fuel, send your daytime contact information to pr@edmunds.com by Friday, June 14, 2013 at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET."
4040,"I think a lot of that horse power thirst comes from needing it to pass left lane campers that run rampant in the US but not in Europe.  The horsepower is needed frequently, and often to get around these traffic causing scumbags."
4041,I test drove at Carmax the '11 C300 and the '12 C250 both priced right at $30K.
4042,"OK.  Just checked with wife. She is kind of an enthusiast driver through the years as observed by me in her driving in the twisities locally and in challenging roads (not interstates) around the country on vacation trips.  She has selected and bought American branded performance cars in the past.  She said she has never heard of the UA designations for Acura cars.  She does know the difference between Acura TL vintages 1999-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013.  Does she need to know more with regards to peculiar factory coding?"
4043,"peculiar factory coding is for ultra- enthusiasts which I am not, sorry"
4044,Nice joke thread about codes for the model years guys
4045,If that's the case I will hold on a little longer to my 2009.
4046,Sorry billy.  This special edition TL is nothing more than an appearance package according to edmunds.com
4047,"Yeah TL sales are around 40% of the peak sales years ago- this beak issue was never addressed the way they quickly fixed the civic- shame car was very attractive to the segment. Unfortunately now it's only attractive because of massive discounts- the looks are just to over the top ugly. I remember in 08, 09 and 10 when I got banned from an acura TL forum because I was questioning  it. My point was Acrua had lost it's way- graphguy and nycitycarguy and smarty666 all over me for saying the current TL has been a disaster, and that both Buick and Hyundai were making huge strides catching Acura. Thanks NYC for reinforcing my point 4 years later, I also like the fact that both NYC and Graph now troll German,'smarty is Mia, I'm still banded but no one looks at that board anymore."
4048,"Those TL Type S' still bring stupid money used.  I don't know what they are crossing the auction block for, but do an autotrader or cars.com search and you'll see quite a few of the 2006 (not sure if 2006 or 2007 was the 1st year) -2008 TL Type S' listed for mid - high teens with over 100K miles."
4049,Wiki has those numbers
4050,"OK. My wife had the UA4-UA5 (BMW and Mercedes afficionados should approve of my detail) 2001 Acura TL.  When the 2004 came out in early Oct 2003, we both test drove it and she said she had to have it because of its improvements in handling and of course styling.  That would be the UA6-UA7 factory codes.  About 3 years later, because she puts lots of miles on her cars, she then wanted to upgrade to the 2007, which was still the UA6-UA7 vintage as long as I would take over her 2004 UA6-UA7 car and put up with the high mileage.  Since her purchase of the UA6-UA7 (2007) both she and I have had occasions to have loaners of the UA8-UA9 gen 2009-2012 when our cars needed routine maintenance beyond simple engine oil changes.  I noticed, just as C&D and other testers, that steering was kind of weird. OK. Now, with a lot of miles on the 2007, and 2004, will Acura come out with a new maybe UA10-UA11 in 2014 or will it be in 2015, that will look great and have improved handling, etc, to entice us to stay with Acura."
4051,"They have pricing detail on bimmerfest for 328 diesel, sedan only so far.  It is $1500 more than gasoline.  This may actually work, for first time.  There are no EPA mileage numbers yet, but depending on driving style and type of driving, but looks better than ever, especially for a highway driving.  Seem like they really want to sell diesel in numbers, for first time."
4052,"Dino, BMW has been stating that the 328d will get 45 on the highway. BMW seems very confident of that number, if that is true, they will sell a lot of them. The Diesel engine will come in the wagon and X3. What I find interesting is, there is no word from BMW is the 328d sedan and or wagon will be available in the Euro Delivery program since Europe does not use Ultra Low Sulfa Diesel. I'm suspecting they wont be."
4053,"Seems ULSD, i.e. less than 10 ppm, is part of already implemented Euro 5 fuel standard, since 2009, so this is no longer a problem."
4054,I'm glad this diesel 3 series is close in price to the normal 3. Sure the base of the 3 is close to midlux level standard cars and you get less for the buck but in diesel form it would be a decent deal given what avg hybrids area going for.  The bmws 3 active hybrid starts at 50k (sure it has 340hp).  Question can you get it in x form?
4055,"Yes, you do."
4056,?
4057,"Hello everyone,"
4058,"Ooops, just one word can change the meaning.  I wanted to say ""yes, THEY do"", i.e. they'll offer xdrive version with 328d.  Sorry."
4059,I figured more than less that it is.
4060,FN....I didn't realize BMW had wagons out.  I just never seen them on the road or at my local dealer.
4061,"Wagons... ""We don't have them because they don't sell"".  Of course they don't sell because nobody has them  :sick:"
4062,"How many times have I heard ""the reason they don't sell is because they offer them"".  Well, they used to offer plenty of wagons and sticks.  However, dealers stopped ordering what they couldn't sell.  What a novel idea.....stock what people buy."
4063,"The problem is of course instant gratification mindset.  Buying a car today means taking it home today.  This is what both customers and dealers want - orders are just additional paperwork and trouble, people can change their minds, every salesman would tell you until it's in the customer's garage, it is not sold.  In other parts of the world there is a different mindset - people basically think if they spend so much money, they want everything right.  It's very common to make an order and wait 3 months.  Here only a few manufacturers (mostly lux brands) are trully geared toward this setup.  Others may do it, but they act as it were a big favor.  There are some dealers that flat out refuse to do a special order, even if the manufacturer takes it.  Then there is Honda and handful of others - they don't take any dealer's orders, they make them and then they push them on the dealers.  I heard there were some bribery scandals in Honda corporate, as dealers were trying to buy their consideration for more attractive lines and models.  The best you can hope for with Honda is that they'll take the ""order"" and try to fit it into what's coming off the production line."
4064,"Yes, dino001.  All engine & transmission configurations MUST be crash tested."
4065,"As to crash tests, I don't know about different engine/transmission combos but I would think a complete different body style would certainly require testing.  A lot of manufactures offer sticks in their entry level models so I wouldn't think just a tranny difference would be much of a player."
4066,"Dino its not that I was misinformed, it as my data is old, and thank you for sharing the info. Is there info on the diesel wagon?"
4067,"No, 328/335 GT and 328d sedan seem to be all that's new for 2014 3-series (and some option/line tweaking, of course), at least now.  I suspect that if it's coming, it'll be 2015 (just a guess).  I say IF just because there is no mentioning of it anywhere but here, by you.  Future vehicles section has nothing, bimmerfest doesn't either."
4068,"Yeah, I can see that.  All makers have allotments and quotas for each model.  The difference is Honda dealer gets the configs what distributor decides, while BMW dealer orders his cars exactly as he/she wants, subject to model allotments with only exclusions being some colors are available only on real customer order only.  Well, ""only"" is a bit strong, because it is quite common for new car managers to make up a fake name if they want that M-line blue on their lot."
4069,"But don't forget that Honda has a much simpler model/feature selection and doesn't have options like other manufacturers.  For the most part it's pick your model, pick your engine, pick your transmission, pick your seat material and select NAV/no NAV."
4070,Dino good response given the source.  Misinformed and old data never a good mix when talking cars on this board. Going to be interesting how this new go around with D cars in the market- Chevy vw BMW trying to make it more mainstream. I've never ridden or drove in a D before- but given the reviews of the prev 335d I would love to.
4071,Listen to yourself man- porshe and Alfa -'come on dude - the last Alfa was imported here what 20 years ago- I stand corrected the [non-permissible content removed] comment should also equate to Alfa owners as well-
4072,"I subscribe to motor trend- and an edmunds user among others. Sure the major publications mention the f30 or e20 or whatever mention of past BMW 3s but if you read these publications you notice it's mentioned once maybe twice- never in the header and never in the stats sheet.  I would say ""vast"" is probably the correct terms- I mean in the states the ""vast"" majority of 3s sold are 399 lease deals (leader ads in flight terms) right."
4073,"What is your problem, man? I like lively discussion, but you seem to be more interested in slinging a small stone and see if somebody jumps.  You continue this on and on.  Snite here, zinger there, small insults in between.  This chip on your sholder is getting bigger by and bigger.  I'm losing my patience.  Go back and read your posts again, then stop trolling.  Disagreements are fine, calling things silly, douchy, etc. is not.  Perhaps it is you needing some intoxicant to take the edge off."
4074,"Dino I'm sorry if you cannot take the response at what they are- my writing is sometimes a little to honest- I agree - but it's fact based (see Altima argument above) - I think if you are going to have an opinion be prepaired to back up any statements - this is a forum - it's a back and forth, some are better prepaired. Blind statements are layups to knock down, everyone has an opinion- doesn't mean it's right of wrong - but some are better researched and fact based, while others are just random thoughts. Again I'm sorry you feel that way."
4075,"Opinions and challenges are fine, the tone can be a problem.  The Altima was a good challenge.  Calling people self centered douches (whether directly or not), because they used some unfamiliar vocabulary is not."
4076,"The idea that one select car company (i guess alfa guys do as well) and its owners uses terms that are not widely used in a car conversation is what it is- this is not just a bmw forum, and I think it's douchie- I never called anyone self centered but this idea that real car enthusiasts have to know the code for a 2001 525 is.  (As noted by my cigar and scotch comment)"
4077,"I personally dont find it snobbish. I find it childish. In a forum where adult car enthusiasts come to discuss, debate, learn about, and/or admire luxury performance cars, slinging personal taunts and making ascerbic condescending comments brings the entire community down."
4078,"I know it may not be in the same performance class as your current BMW wagon, but it may be comparable to the latest one, but the Volvo V60 is coming to North America, by all reports it is a very nice driving car, and with BMW toning down the sportiness, and Volvo upping it a bit, it may even wind up being a better drive ( probably not, but the s60 is apparently pretty good, and since the v60 is the wagon version it should also be good)."
4079,"But I love single malt & Cubans.  As an Audi owner I'm aware of enhanced engine sound, but there are many that do it & more to come. Just reading reviews will tell you that. That being said, I would take the 4.2 in my S5 over"
4080,"Just thinking about BMW's E Codes.  I know MB uses ""W"" codes, but I have NO CLUE what they are.  So I can understand if someone who is an auto enthusiast, but not completely focused on BMWs doesn't know ""E"" codes."
4081,"If you are not completely focused on BMW, then I contend you are not an auto enthusiast"
4082,That's nice about ethanol-free...   nothing within 50 miles of where I live...
4083,"Sure, I don't expect people to know all the codes. I learned these codes just a few years ago, when I started reading bimmerfest and other related posts.  I don't know all of them, either.  If somebody throws an unfamiliar code, my reaction would be either check it myself, of politely ask where I can find it, so I know what it is.  Same comes to many acronyms and abbreviations used - I sometimes have to go to a dictionary to find out what all they mean - English being a second language and all."
4084,Ha!
4085,Very true
4086,In my defense I'll remind everyone that the codes I used in the reply to a post were probably the best known in the BMW world
4087,I just got an email from my dealer in regards to a special edition 2014 TL.
4088,"According to the Temple of VTEC, it's keyless access, push button start, 18"" wheels, lip spoiler and SE badging:"
4089,Hear they are adding another foot to the grill and putting more chrome everywhere as well. Also spec is they are going to expand the name even further - Acura 3.7 Tl - sh-awd sde (super Dupper edition) .
4090,"Xrunner - come on all real Ellps guys know the Fourth generation code as UA8-UA9, silly. Knowing honda products they use this car as a filler car- a car that appeals to the masses- so they can sell more of them- it usually has more features then the base but its not a marked out edition as ""special"" would indicate. It's based off the UA8. Shame they didn't make a type -s edition. Most enthusiasts agree the UA6-UA7 was the best edition of this car if equipped with type -s and 6 speed."
4091,"I'm happy to clarify,  for your wife she had the Second generation (UA4-UA5) this was for her 01. I'm sure she would agree the current car is vastly superior, while a lot heavy and not as attractive."
4092,Fair-
4093,Gotcha.  No offense taken.  I used to always think the newer is better while having respect to what a previous model was & that people who complained that an older generation of is far superior to the new model were just being stubborn & ridiculous.  I really feel that BMW has taken a completely new direction with the current generation 3 series that I personally do not like.  Only time & the sales figures will tell.
4094,"I always wanted new versions and was excited with every new launch.  I'm an option hog, newer cars tend to have more equipment standard and more optional.  They usually have stronger engines, better transmissions.  The chassis are usually stiffer and the ride is usually a bit more refined within each model's target audience.  All those were reasons why I liked new models over outgoing ones.  New 3-series improves a lot of things on paper - it has more torque (328 anyway), better automatic transmission, it finally has rear split folddown seat standard (but of course 320i does not).  It is larger, which majority wanted, but I did not."
4095,"BTW, the straight six/ vs turbo - I don't expect you to understand this and you don't have to agree.  Engine audio effects are indeed non-essential parts of driving experience.  All I can tell you I hear the difference and I like the old one more.  You don't care and I do.  Both is OK.  People have different levels of sound sensitivity and awareness."
4096,I get there are different model codes for cars- infact I'm sure Nissan and ford have different codes for a maxima and the fusion. The fact that BMW enthusiasts use these terms like they invented codes seem silly and douchie to me.
4097,"You are right that BMW cares about 2 things (like every other automaker), selling as many cars as they can and making as much profit off of those cars.  As much as we love certain cars, they have to change.  They have to add more safety features.  They have to add more luxury goodies.  They have to add different wheels.  They have to change for the sake of change."
4098,"Absolutely.  However, there is a danger when all brands converge into one.  Over long periods, regardless of product or service, it is those companies that have something that differentiates them from the crowd that win.  Superior services, lowest price, best value (as price/content), best quality (whichever way one defines quality), etc.  Prior the pedal fiasco, Toyota was uncontested reliability leader - their cars never had cutting edge equipment, never been safest in the market, or offered best value in terms of price of content.  But they delivered expected features on time.  When nobody asked for side impact airbags or ABS, they were either unavailable, or never delivered, when those features because standard of service, Toyota did not procrastrinate."
4099,Thanks guys I like being told I'm right it feels great and appreshiated. Wish my wife would go along with that- or even flight for that matter.
4100,"I'm referring to Nissan from 90s, not 2000s.  Altima was a pittiful car then, Maxima was not much better.  Whole line was gutted of any sportyness.  2000 (or so) Altima was indeed the car that saved Nissan, along with that 3.5l V6 engine."
4101,"From the 90s ...  (For model Code guys, the w5245) Really ? never mentioned in the long post above might of misses it thou.  I think Nissan has done ok with the Altima. And the comment about the 3.5 is funny- most of the cars they sell in bulk are 4 cyl under the Nissan name and have done so for 10 years plus years. Sure the engine has had many awards and pulls like a mofo . But look at sales (10 years) of maximas, pathfinders , and to a lesser extent large rogue (name excapes me) and tell me it saved the brand? Maybe you mean saved Infiniti ?"
4102,"The 3.5 was put in Altima, Maxima, Murano, Pathfinder, Xterra, Frontier, Quest, Z350, all Infinities but top of the line (G, I, FX, EX, M).  It was highly acclaimed at the time, universally acknowledged as one of best.  Yes, Altimas were selling mostly 2.5, but all cars above Altima had that engine and it was responsible for their success.  Especially Z350, Murano, G35, FX."
4103,"While I kind of get what you are saying, customers looked at the up crust of Nissan and said wow let's go fast but they bot the 4. No one is saying the engine isn't a good one but I can't quantify with hard numbers the 6 had anything to do with saving the brand, sorry. If its a feeling it saved the brand again it's a feeling, not fact."
4104,"Yep it's language only reserved for bmw Enthusists, to me it's douchie talk. Year and model number please like every other car on the planet."">"
4105,"These are mfr codes for two and three generations back of 3-series model.  Easier than saying 198x to 9x, especially that coupes or convertibles are introduced two or even three years after sedan versions of same platform.  With the code, it is more precise."
4106,"Please tell me the last mb post was - or even a reference to wx code you speak of on this chat board.  Again I get the reason behind such codes, but I don't think I and other non-bmw owners (lovers) NEED to do such homework you speak of- we are not naive infact many of us actually are just as much of enthusiasts even without owning a propeller badge. Sure the Germans as you say invented the category - but as you can see from the right hand column they make up less then half the field."
4107,"FN....I really love the sound of the motor in the S4.  That said, I also know it has what Audi calls a ""soundaktor"".  In short, it supplements the sound of the engine which allegedly makes it more pleasing.  However, I've test driven the A6 3.0 S/C (a detuned version of the S4's engine).  It sounds about the same, just quieter."
4108,"My issue is BMW is not nearly as luxurious inside, especially in their base trims, as say Audi or MB.  Wood inlays really improve the look, also some of those touches you get with those Lux, Sport or M-line packages.  The base aluminum trim is quite dull, if you ask me.  Their dashboard consoles always look like a 1980s recycle, the competition is light years ahead in styling of the dials and gauges, or center area.  It was allright when BMW was the true athlete of the bunch, one took it because the looks didn't count, it was the driving.  However, when the steering disaster of those F-coded models took hold, suddenly I ask myself, why would I pay 5 extra grand for this (of course once it is time for my current car to go).  So far the only way I see BMW winning me over is by those ""peripheral"" models like GT, wagon, or perhaps X1, or X3.  I find it easy to imagine that those are still sportiest of their peers.  Nobody else makes proper wagons anymo, i.e. sedan from hood to center pillar, extended back, no stupid raised suspensions, body claddings or other crossover crap. I believe TSX will be gone soon,  so the new 328 wagon may be still in the mix just because there is nothing else left, unless new CTS will still feature wagon.  335 GT could have been a good alternative - killer engine, great space arrangement, but from early reports the steering and suspension are even more vague and soft than sedan/wagon.  But is there anything like that around?  The rest is the crossover stuff.  If I did cross over, indeed, perhaps Audi Allroad - never tried that one.  Honda Crosstour or Subaru Outback, if I wanted to save some money.  But it's not the same thing than proper sporty wagon.  Those are practically dead."
4109,"It's not just reserved for BMW Enthusiast, my buddies in the Alfa club understand the different between a E39 and a E30. Most auto (not all) enthusiast know the difference between 964,996 and a 997 in Porsche speak."
4110,"Wagons have been on death watch for quite a few years.  For all intents and purposes, the TLX and BMW wagons are indeed going away, unfortunately. IMHO, they were the best of the breed."
4111,"This is why if I was looking for a M5, the E39 would be the one I'd be looking at. Not too heavy, built proof engine, excellent handling."
4112,"scw....I happen to like the way the new Lincolns look too.  I think the big knock on them is there's little to differentiate them from their more humble step sibblings from Ford.  I don't know which models compare from Ford to Lincoln.  But, from what I've read, you'd be hard pressed to see why the Lincolons cost extra thousands when moving from a Fusion, Taurus, etc to their Lincoln counterparts."
4113,"C&D, June issue, test drove Lexus IS350, BMW335i and Cadillac ATS 3.6.  Lexus finishes first, BMW second, Cadillac third."
4114,Seems that BMW gave up the spot voluntarily rather than Lexus leaping over.  That is sad.
4115,GC the the Fusion is the MKZ and the Taurus is the MKS.
4116,"FN...I think part of Lincoln's problem is I don't know their models anymore....and I'm probably one of their market targets if I had to guess.  Plus, I don't know what advantage they offer over any of their competitors in the same price class."
4117,"Thanks everyone for the replies.  I guess I am looking for the perfect, do everything car.  You were right on the money with the Murano....I am sure I can get a great deal HAHA.  Best thing for me likely is to keep the G sedan and look for a used jeep or mita to have as a fun car!!  Problem is convincing the wife that ""I need it"""
4118,"GG, last week Rick and I went to the Audi dealer, I'm looking at the A5 as the new ride. While talking to the saleman, he was telling us about the A8 and B&O soundsystem.  They had a S8 in the showroom, and he demoed the sound system, I would buy the A/S/8 just for that system, incredible simply incredible. The sound stage was right up in front of the driver and passenger.  Deep rich lows and crystal clear highs (without hurting ones ears.) However, the entrance to this sound system is steep, but if you want a A8 or S8 money isn't an issue. The B&O sound system in the A5 is good but not as good as the A8 or S8.  Now if I can only find a excellent used S5........"
4119,"How do you find the time to go to so many dealers- Audi, Porsche , etc and test drive these cars and somehow walk out without anything?"
4120,"fed....sorry....little late checking in.  Not around here much recently.  I love Daft Punk.  Actually have ""Get Lucky"" and some others from that same album on my iPod.  Thanks for the recommendation."
4121,"I have test-driven most of the cars mentioned and owned a TL until about three years ago.  I admit that the TL is a solid, reliable, down-the-middle performer in spite of the FWD (haven't driven an SH), but they are less cushy than an ES, handle much worse than any of the Audi's mentioned, the Beemers, or the G37 and their styling--ugh!  I find a lot of the comments about the ATS mystifying.  Try a performance-trim ATS 3.6 and see how the TL stacks up.  My biggest complaints with the ATS are the terrible color choices and cheesy interior trims.  Also, for some reason, Cadillac dealers want to overpopulate their lots with boring silver and annoying black ATS's (probably because they sell the best to the public!).  My wife, however, dislikes the colors and appointments of the ATS even more than I do, so forget that.  She wants to buy a small SUV--gag me!  I may be stuck with an Infiniti coupe.  Sad huh?"
4122,"This may be old news for some, but I just learned that - I ran across the C&D comparison of top end of ELLPS (Lexus IS350F, Caddy ATS 3.6 and BMW 335i ).  And the winner is... Lexus  :surprise:  :surprise:  :surprise:  :surprise: On Car and Driver, high priests of BMW cult machine!!   There were some knockouts of other magazines before. I remember many years ago Automobile or Road and Track put G350 over 330i, but the win was mostly on ground of value, as G was proclaimed a bit worse, but price difference made it win on adjusted score.  But this time it is C&D.  Moreover, the IS won was based on driving experience, not some secondary metrics.  The biggest complaint against 335i was the miserable steering feel, which was pretty much what I thought myself on that 328i loaner.  This is basically telling me BMW gave up on being true enthusiast sports sedan, or succumbed to gas mileage pressure.  Electromechanical steering probably gives them extra mpg's."
4123,"For those of you who are also on CCBA & SFTSF, this is a re-post:"
4124,What's this? a bimmer pity party?
4125,"Yes, you didn't get the memo?  :P"
4126,"warthog...just goes to show.  Different experiences and expectations by different people.  Personally, I found the ATS (both 3.6 and 2.0 turbo) to be coarse (much like the new 4 cyl turbo BMWs that NYC speaks about and the older G 3.7).  The performance delta between the 3.6 V6 and the 2.0 4 cyl turbo is negligible. And, despite the ballyhoo Cadillac bombarded us with, it has not sold to expectations."
4127,"GRAPH, sort of like me with the GS."
4128,Dino & I kinda think alike when it comes to cars.  It is funny that he posted about the F30 on the same day I got my F30 loaner and HAD to comment on it as well.
4129,"You can't compare a ATS 3.6 with a base TL, IF you want to do that then compare it to the stop of the line SH."
4130,"This review - and I'm not a bmw homer like most here- is it more Buyers remorse or just a belief that the old underpowered ""smoother"" 6 is better  then the more effecent and more powerful 4... Doesn't the 4 pull 60 more lbs of torque? Have more hp- have standard leather (sorry I kid)"
4131,"I most definitely DO NOT have a shred of buyer's remorse.  I do dig the power of the turbo 4.  Gobs more power everywhere in the rev range.  It is perfectly matched to the new 8 speed automatic as well.  I'm just not in love with the F30.  The vague electric power steering, the softer suspension, the higher belt line.  The base tires have too tall side walls, there's too much of a gap in the wheel wells, I don't care for the front end styling if the car doesn't have Xenon Headlights.  Don't get me wrong, the F30 is a nice car.  Just not for me."
4132,"Sween referred to the naturally aspirated 230 hp engine in E9x 328 models, not the 300+ hp turbo six in 335 that you are writing about in C&D test.  Two different engines."
4133,Lets go thru this babble one line at a time.....
4134,"Engine yes, transmission no, though the may be a few common parts in the transmission ( a transverse FWD tranny just can't be exactly the same as a longitudinally mounted RWD tranny).   Besides that very little in common, the Xts is built on the epsilon ii platform that it shares ( though the xts's may be an updated epsilon II platform) with the Buick Lacrosse, the CTS is built on ( shoot forget what the name of the current CTS platform is) a platform not shared with any other GM product ( though it used to share it with the SRX ans STS), the upcoming CTS will be built on an extended and ( I beileve widened) ATS platform, so still nothing besides engine and maybe some programming in common so no I don't think the XTS and CTS are anywhere near the same car in the way the Avalon and ES are."
4135,+1
4136,Graph- I might be drifting towards your end-Audi.
4137,"I can understand top down, windows up, cap on.  My pet peeve is top up, windows up, AC cranking on a gorgeous day."
4138,"billy...have you driven the A6 yet?  I'll be keeping the S4 for a couple more years.  But, they normally give me an A6 as a loander when I'm in for service.  The 3.0 supercharged motor is a real gem.  I'd give up a little handling, and the A6 is certainly heavier.  But, I'd certainly choose it over a 5 series.  It's less expensive than a 5, too..equipped like for like."
4139,Thanks for answering for me.
4140,"Funny thing, my mechanic told me the same thing too, additionally he is advocating for me to keep the TL. He keeps mentioning that it looks like I bought it yesterday-thanks to the many Zaino products and a garage."
4141,"Billy....one of the things I miss most from the TL are the headlights.  My S4 has HIDs with LEDs. The TL ""only"" has HIDs.  They are worlds better than the Audi's lamps.  Same goes for the A6."
4142,Graph- I get it- you are INDIRECTLY telling me to stick with the TL.
4143,billy.....LOL!  It's your money.  I can spend it for you if you'd like.
4144,"Actually, I went back in December 2012and test drove the A6 extensively."
4145,"Like you've said many times GG, none of us (with possibly the exception of Roadburner & Fedlawman) comes close to our respective cars limits of acceleration & adhesion, especially on public roads.  No matter how fast we tackle twisty back roads or blast off onto an open highway."
4146,"'Like you've said many times GG, none of us (with possibly the exception of Roadburner & Fedlawman) comes close to our respective cars limits of acceleration & adhesion, especially on public roads. '"
4147,"It was a 1600, however, I placed a 2L in it as I blew the 1.6 engine. I sold it and bought a 69 510, which was a fun car, with a stroked 2L in it."
4148,"well, I track my car. So  :P"
4149,I knew I forgot someone :surprise: .  You know what I was getting at.  flightnurse is a track guy too.
4150,"Q...you've been tracking for a lng while.  Those track events are well behind me.  However, I do enjoy a well engineered, sporting car on a challenging road."
4151,I spend a lot of time driving and listening to music while driving so good sound is very important to me. I would speculate that car lovers usually love music too.
4152,"Leo.....I have a Bang & Olufson system in my Audi.  It's really good.  But, the best I've ever heard is ithe ELS system in the Acura."
4153,"GG there are three different versions of the B&O sound system in the Audi's, I was very impressed with the A8, with the movable tweeters on the dash, the A6 and A4 didn't have the clear highs that the A8 had."
4154,"I saw a MKZ on the road yesterday, and I have to say appearance wize it is very nice ( now do I know where it fits in performance wize no, and I am not about to guess without actually driving it agains the other cars in its class).  I do think it looks much better on person than in photos ( and was quite eye catching).  So I guess at least the styling direction at Lincoln is going the right way ( I have to agree with those who think the engineering side may be a bit lacking) but at least they aren't just producing an exact clone of a fusion and slapping a Lincoln grill on it and saying done, they at least differentiated it this time."
4155,"""Like you've said many times GG, none of us (with possibly the exception of Roadburner & Fedlawman) comes close to our respective cars limits of acceleration & adhesion, especially on public roads."""
4156,just watched the latest episode of Motorweek (On Velocity!  And i remember when it was on PBS).
4157,stickguy...saw that.
4158,A 328 is quicker to 60 than the sh-awd?
4159,"billy...can't remember the 0-60 times, nor the configurations.  I'd be hard pressed to believe that a 4 cyl (albeit turbo) would outperform the OHC 6 in the TL, with SH-AWD."
4160,Here are the numbers:
4161,I watched Motor Week tested the TL at 5.5 to 60 and now they are sayin 7 plus- those guys are not trustworthy.
4162,"Billy....my sister just bought a TL SH AWD Advance.  5.5 secs sounds about right on the 0-60.  Motor Week is off in their estimate.  Don't know why...maybe a misprint?  Or, they were testing the TL on a wet/oily track?  And the rest were tested on a dry track?"
4163,"they tested them all at the same time/place.  Even showed clips of the runs.  I don't think they do it like say car and driver (more like CR?).  But for whatever reason, the TL was not that fast."
4164,"One thing I note is that a lot of the cars mentioned are smaller euro-sedans.  And while this is fine, if you want a large car, you're looking at a Big Lexus, Acura, Cadillac, Mercedes, Volvo, Audi, or BMW.   Others do make similar cars, but they tend to be overpriced or far more sport than luxury."
4165,"""And while this is fine, if you want a large car,"""
4166,stick....I get what you're saying.
4167,"""Lexus. Pretty much the ES here, since it is based on the Camry platform."""
4168,IVAN...agree with your assessments.
4169,"I drove my brother-in-laws new E class last week.  It seemed plenty big to me.  I even sat in the back for a short time.  Of course, the ride was quiet & smooth with plenty of power.  But, the ""leather"" seats felt plastic like and, most surprisingly, the steering felt on the over assisted side.  Which made me wonder, can the steering type be selected by the driver?  Maybe it was selected to the most assisted position."
4170,"""A quick run - down:"
4171,"Well, sport suspension and tires, plus a massively heavy AWD system that 90% of people will never benefit from are a whole other animal.   The base model is, styling aside, a big, well built FWD car that drives a lot like a Park Avenue Ultra did.  The better GM cars didn't have a problem with handling if you got the touring or sport package."
4172,"pletko...I see where you're coming from.  Those old Buick Park Aves with the handling package and supercharged V6 motors were pretty good cars.  Base TL, while still a better handling car and a better performing car...I could see a comparison made."
4173,"How about the Engine and Transmission, I'm sure there are some software differences but I'm sure there are more common connections between the two cars then you think"
4174,"So a bit of a different topic, but given the discussion of many types of cars.  This may sound like a strange question, but living in the northeast, I much prefer AWD over RWD.  Has anyone ever heard if Infiniti will build a AWD G convertible?  Id much prefer a hard top over a soft top.  The Volve C-70 doesn't do much for me and I dont want the soft top of the A5 for year round driving."
4175,"Larry...no 'vert AWD Infinitis.  Matter of fact, only convertible 4WD I can think of would be in the Jeep showroom."
4176,I thought Lexus (SC) and BMW made hard tops convertible?
4177,There's always the (freakish) Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet!  Who wouldn't want a 4-door midsize CUV converted into 2-door mutant convertible sorta thing???   And they only cost about $45k with the Nav package..
4178,"BMW makes a hard top convertible with 4 seats (328i & 335i) but they're not AWD. I don't know of any AWD convertibles other than the Audi A5. Those A5's are very, very nice looking despite my bias towards BMW. I don't know how the soft top would work out in the winter though."
4179,"""There's always the (freakish) Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet! """
4180,"You can get an Audi vert in Quattro now, I think.."
4181,You guys are right....Audi A5 Quattro convertible.  Would be great.  How could I forget it? :surprise:
4182,4WD Convertible?  The Jeep gets my vote (& maybe the vote that counts).
4183,"I like stuff.  I like equipment.  It's just not everything.  I was always complaining about Subaru witholding some high end options from their WRX line (e.g. HID lights were not available, except STI for three generations).  BMW forces people to buy some nice or even basic stuff for extra charge.  Split fold-down seats, which is my pet peeve, was not standard on 328/335 sedan until this year.  It is still not standard on 320i.  That is purely ridiculous.  However, just because Kia has more standard equipment than BMW, it is not automatically ""more car"".  Moreover, BMW seems to be getting away with their pricing practice."
4184,"2013 Avalon...2014 Impala...the current ""Big"" cars...maybe the new CTS in this ELLPS category."
4185,"I would happily buy a diesel economy car, luxury car, utility vehicle, etc. but not a sports car. Like an automatic transmission, having a 4K redline just sucks fun out of the driving experience."
4186,If BMW puts this motor in a 5-series & sells it here
4187,Ditto.  I think it sucks much more than modern automatics (they made huge progress).
4188,"Damn you Ray, you beat me to it, I know that BMW has teased us with photos of the 550d, I just don't see BMW bring it over, just yet. I would say that having a car that is capable of some serious fun and still get descent MPG is a draw for some, but in the price point of the 550d, not many would be buying it because of it's MPG. I would assume people who bought it on the used car lot would understand the benefits of the MPG as well as the statement BMW is making with the car."
4189,"15% market share would be enormous growth in the segment - 500%+!   And I would not call it ""small"" at all.  That is significant marketshare, it would mean diesels are everywhere, offered by every manufacturer.  One out of 7 vehicles, from Spark to Suburban, from Carrera to Ram 1500.  It is certainly attainable, mostly by having diesel engines in pickups, SUVs and even family wagons/crossovers."
4190,"I am looking for an entry level luxury sedan that is atleast as big as Camry to hold 5 adults comfortably.   Looking for something under $50 - $55K.  I know this is a performance forum, but that is not an important criteria for me.   Which Sedans will fit that category?"
4191,Go to page 796 and start reading at post #15902.
4192,"In addition to following fedlawman's direction, I'd also look at...."
4193,"I have a 2013 Volvo S60 T5 FWD.  A great car - fun to drive, easy on gas, very comfortable front seats BUT, I don't think 2 adults would be comfortable in that back seat for any length of time.  As for 3 adults, forget about it!!"
4194,"I looked at BMW 3 series and they are very small.  Will not work.  Same thing for Audi A4.  I also looked at Acura TL and Lexus ES 350, they still seem a little smaller than Camry (is that correct?, hard to tell).  Is Audi A6 bigger than TL and ES?"
4195,"ES350 is not smaller than Camry, it should be larger.  A6 is bigger, also much more expensive."
4196,"Good to know that ES350 is not smaller than Camry.  A6 looks good too.  Need to actually go and look at both of these now.   In terms of price, looks like A6 will come out about 4K more than ES350 (have to add in the options for ES350 since not a whole lot standard).   So for 4K more, is A6 the better Sedan?"
4197,"Are you sure A6 is only 4 grand more?  There are plenty of options there, too and they'd drive up the price with breath taking speed.  I always thought Lexus was much better in standard content than German brands.  Not as good as Acura, but still - especially ES, I thought was well equipped out of the gates.  Things change, I guess."
4198,"You're knocking on the door of $50K MSRP for an A6 2.0 Premium Plus auto.  You won't get the fancy stereo, but you will get Nav for that price (less a couple thousand for discount)."
4199,the 2.0 CVT A6 fully loaded comes to be 50K MSRP and fully loaded ES350 (luxury package) comes to be around 46K MSRP.  So it is a 4K difference.   I am more worried about the maintenance cost for Audi since I plan to keep the car for long time (10 - 15 years).
4200,"If it came to those two cars, I'd probably get Lexus - 2.0 CVT Audi would be least interesting vehicle to me.  Audi without quattro is to me like decaf or non-alcoholic beer.  Not to mention it probably is pretty stripped for the class. Doesn't mean completely stripped, just I suspect if you wanted same equipment as on ES, you'd have to pay more than $50K.  The only advantage is probably size, but how would that four-cylinder engine perform on such large and heavy car? ES350 would feel like a rocket in comparison.   But if that's not really important to you (I can easily imagine relatively underpowered car being enough for majority of drivers) than you may like Audi."
4201,"dino...Audi's ext warranties and maintenance plans are indeed more sanely priced than many.  That's damning them with faint praise, however.  As none of those plans are worth what the car companies charge for them, given the dealers and manufacturers get to use a large chunk of your change basically for free, over a period of years."
4202,"How about a 2013 Avalon?  I had a 2005 and it was a great car with a limo-like back seat.  I'm told the new one handles better, although some have said the ride is harsh.  I know that it's not considered ""entry luxury"" but it can be loaded up with lots of advanced tech features.  It might be worth a look."
4203,"Also, outside the box is the Cadillac XTS.  Again, not an entry level luxury sedan but a large sedan.  They start at 45 and go up from there.  So, it depends on how many gadgets you want."
4204,Please take a few minutes to answer our survey:
4205,I hope this survey leads to changes all of us carnuts would like to see in these forums.
4206,We hope so too - that's why we're asking!
4207,"180 hp for diesel is a lot.  I think calling it 328d is appropriate here, as the 280 lb-ft torque is even larger than 328i (much shorter though, of course).   IMHO the renaming to 328d is also a tell regarding the expected price.  If past history is to guide us, it is reasonable to expect price differential similar to  that between E90-based 335d and 335i."
4208,Guys a with a little help from google you can get most of the info
4209,"They have been able to charge more for ""less car"" (using your definition anyway) for fifty years now, so I don't know - perhaps another fifty years?"
4210,"The definition is fact,  just look at the Msrps -and what comes standard   :surprise: z"
4211,"end up driving these things these days are so far from what BMW used to be that it's a sociology study.  BMW is now a volume seller of vehicles to whomever can be convinced to buy (or more likely, lease) them.  The enthusiasts who built the brand are no longer necessary."
4212,"I meant to say, ""stuff"" is not everything.  It is possible to sell ""more car"" with less ""stuff"".  Lotus would be an example.  My point BMW has always been more expensive in relation to Acura, Lexus, or Audi.  They have always got away with it.  Will they in the future?  Only time will tell."
4213,"Dino when it comes to MPG the diesel engine will make more MPG as the engine get miles. In regards to the VW, when new the Golf, Jetta and other VW cars with the TDI get good miles when new, however, the more miles on the engine the better the MPG, on the Diesel forum people post their real world MPG and it is amazing to see the difference. I'm thinking the same will be said with the 328d, put 10-15K on the engine and a true mid 40s on the highway would be doable. The true value of the diesel is not to  own it for 3 years (lease) and then turn it in, but to own it for 10 yrs."
4214,"I really wanted a BMW Bavaria, in 1972."
4215,"ray....I concur with you.  The ""new"" BMWs just aren't ""doing it"" for me.  I have no desire for a diesel. While their 4 cyl turbos are interesting, they sort of fall down on the NVH scale."
4216,"OK, so I did test drive the Infiniti G37 and BMW 328 and 528.  Here is what I think"
4217,Have you thought about the Hyundai Genesis?  It's probably in same price point as the LS or C but will give you GS/5/E amenities.
4218,"Just curious - what is your reason for large back seat?  Do you often carry three full size adults, or is your kid(s) over 6-3 tall?  Just curious, you obviously have reasons, but I often found out that imposed search parameters people use are often imaginary rather than real.  For example, non-existent boat that ""could"" be pulled by the vehicle (that's why ""need"" for a big truck based SUV, or mother-in-law visiting town once a year being a reason to get seven passenger vehicle).  In other words, the air is as comfortable in 328 than as in Avalon."
4219,"I have three kids.  Two will be in child seat (not the rear facing or the booster).  Just two regular car seat.   The third is older kid in the middle, not requiring car seat.  I tried that on 328.  Did not work well.  Very uncomfortable."
4220,Need a minivan?
4221,Already have one.  Need a sedan that can sit 5 comfortably.  Currently have a Camry and it does the job well.
4222,"I'm kind of in the same boat as you.  I've got 3 kids.  For family hauling duties we've got a 2011 Honda Pilot.  My DD is a 2011 328xi which is actually smaller than the current generation 328xi that you drove.  90% of the time it is just me in the car.  If I need to take 2 kids with me, I can put their car seats (high back booster seats) in the back of my BMW.  They actually prefer the back if my 2001 Honda Prelude.  My point is that I don't need 2 cars that'll fit all 5 of us."
4223,"Howa about 328 wagon?  it is just about to be released.  Same driving experience as sedan (I know, I have one previous gen, there is no difference from sedan), same legroom, but better access to back seat and more back headroom than sedan.  Since your passengers are kids, not adults, legroom is not as critical, but improved access maj just do the trick.   And you get extra cargo space for kids' stuff.  If you wait another six months, there will be 328/335 GT, more legroom in the back, better access."
4224,the one thing that the wagon won't have happens to be the key issue.  Back seat width.
4225,"I understand what  you are saying, but my ""what if"" happens everyday.  I prefer to use the van on long drives or when there is lot of cargo to hold.   On regular basis I would like to use the sedan."
4226,"someone over on the Accord thread just posted about how much they love their new Accord V6, and compared it to an ES.  Pretty much all the features, and 12K less.  and a big back seat."
4227,Understood
4228,"I don't know if I told you or not Dino, but they had an F3X 328i wagon at the ny auto show in (I think) deep sea blue, & it was drop dead gorgeous.  By far my favorite looker of the F30 line."
4229,ilexus....thanks for sharing your impressions.
4230,"Yeah, it does look nice on pictures.  Deep sea blue is also color of my E91 (BTW, the new one has letter code F31).  Funny it was my third choice (crimson red was first, le mans blue was second, but neither was available, as they discountinued red for that last year and le mans blue required M-package, well over 1 grand extra, which I did not order).  Yet, when I saw it on the platform in Munich and ever since, I thought it can't be better.  The only true downside of it, it is a dust magnet, especially in the back.  Just like black, if not more.  My previous red STI and blue WRX did not require as much cosmetic attention, as this one."
4231,"Did not think of that, you make sense.  So it seems for kids out of the booster seat the backseat space is not an issue, but yeah, I see your point on the real young ones."
4232,Didn't Accord just get smaller in this generation?
4233,What he means is a car is not its options that come standard.
4234,"lexusbuyer....yes, do yourself a favor and test drive the others you mentioned, if for no other reason to satisfy your curiosity."
4235,"Have you looked at the price for Avalon recently flightnurse?  If I go for the limited Avalon XLE with technology package, it is the same price as Lexus ES350 with luxury package.   If I do not go with the limited Avalon, it is around 4 - 5K less.   So there is no 10 - 15K difference.   So lets not just use generic statements and be factual."
4236,"The Avalon is a bigger car, so if you want the room in the back seats, this is the car to go with. I have never been a big fan of Lexus, most of the Lexus line is a tart up Toyota, The ES was a Camry, the LX and GS are 4 runner and a Land Cruiser."
4237,"It's true, but you seem to knocked the entire brand in your comment, not just ES - or at least that's how I read it."
4238,"The only car that I ever liked of the Lexus line was the original SC300/400, which by the way was a Toyota in Japan called the Soarer. So for the most part, Lexus had and in some ways still uses tart up Toyota's and sell them for huge profits."
4239,"Yes, Dino the prices you have are right and the last 5 generation of the ES was built from the Camry Chassis. This current generation is built of the Toyota Avalon. So, which one got the better deal, the Avalon or the ES?"
4240,"Can't tell, never looked at them.  I suspect Avalon is better per pound or cubic foot, but ES is likely nicer and probably will have some unique touches.  Not sure, if that's enough and what is the real price difference for ""equivalent"" configurations."
4241,"I can vouch that the GTI and A3 are indeed, vastly different cars, despite being similar.   No one that has driven an A3 for an extended period of time would say the upgrades are not worth it vs. the GTI."
4242,"I remember a point in time that buying a Lexus....any Lexus...meant MSRP only.  When the IS first came out, I was mildly interested in one.  Aside from them being relatively underpowered, they handled decently.  And, they certainly had the interior ""eye candy"" appeal."
4243,Don't you get a better warranty with a Lexus?  Also the dealer here provides a loaner anytime the car is in for repairs.  You don't get that with an Avalon.
4244,"I initially thought BMW will bring 320d.  It is actually bringing 328d, which I suspect will have higher/similar torque to 328i, nominally lower power (as all diesels do due to lower revs).  They announce 45 mpg highway.  Say it's true.  Let's also assume it will be priced between 328i and 335i, so starting MSRP in low-mid 40s ($43K-$45K) sprinting to $50K with just leather and couple of conveniences.  Price difference about 3-5 grand with 328 and about 10+ with 320i (which is also stripped vs. 328i, not just engine). Taking them at face value we get 45 mpg highway vs 33 mpg (AT), good difference.  I would caution excuberrance, as I have seen in the past other manufacturers promising outlandish values on their diesels in preanouncements to end up as much as 10 mpg lower after EPA tests (that was the case with new VW diesel).  So let's assume 15 thousand miles per year, five years of ownership, 75K miles.  Lets assume MSRP of $45K (328i) vs $48K (328d), i.e. we have some options, all miles are highway (for simplicity) - we get:"
4245,Warranty= probably a year more.
4246,I have nothing to add to this besides my thanks- excellent post- interesting when someone runs the numbers- and comes up with a value creative post.
4247,Well said & well thought out my friend - as always!
4248,"Beware what you wish for. I love manual transmissions, all but one car I have had were MT, but IMHO if there is a case of AT, it is small diesel engine.  MT is least suitable for small diesel engines.  Short rev range of the engine turns the driving into constant shifting for shifting's sake.  Unlike modern gasoline engine (which is very flexible in both low and high rev range), diesel engine makes it really miserable on driver to be in a wrong gear.  It either shakes the car violently (too high gear for the revs) or drops the torque of the cliff making passing or merging really scary if you need to execute 2-second gear upshift in the middle of the maneuver.  On to of that, in city driving you feel you end up shifing up and down on 5-10 mph speed differentials, so you don't those low vibrations from the engine compartment.  How do I know all of that?  I drove similarly sized and powered A4 and Peugeout 406, both with manual transmissions.  Both of those were considered one of the best diesel engines of their generations."
4249,"Dino, the engine in the 328d is a 2 liter 180hp, 280 lbs, BMW was going to call it 320d, but changed it to 328d. The car will only come with the 8 spd auto, which will work very well with the engine. BMW has been VERY tight lipped about the MPG of the car, however, many have guessed that mid 40's is doable on the highway, and mid 30's in town.  This engine will go in the Wagon as well as the X3. Road and Track has driven the car and they were impressed, it was a short drive, I'm sure a full report will be out soon."
4250,"Behind the comment (which the poster will never address) was meant as a derogatory term, so yes billy like the Beak of the 2008-2011 TL that's left it's mark on Acura sales its left a mark. - and I guess in a way I do wear a backwards hat. So yes billy I'm a little stuck on the comment - i love story's about GF and trips to Chicago and how great life is- but please don't tell us why someone who owns a BMW is embarrassed by someone who has Xenons on an old Altima- or the fact the Car next to him has a tinted windows. Joke"
4251,oh-okay.
4252,Good responce - thanks for the detailed comment- wasn't 2 decades ago. I stand by what I said.
4253,Thank you everyone for your advice. This weekend I continue the saga to find my next car and here's the report.
4254,A very nice and detailed report by leoblue.
4255,"Great write up & a fantastic choice.  We've all got our preferences, but you can't go wrong in this class.  Please feel free to stick around & post your ownership & driving impressions!"
4256,"So I am in the market for entry level luxury.   I have narrowed my choices to Lexus ES350, InfinitiG37, BMW 328,i, BMW 335i.   Anyone has any +ve/-ve about any of these?   I am leaning towards ES350, but at this point still open."
4257,"all fine cars, in their own way, but quite a bit different from each other.  so the answer really depends on what is important to you.  Based on these choices, the fact that you are leaning toward the ES says to me that you desire quite comfy luxury, not sporty.  If so, fine choice!"
4258,"lexusbuyer...based solely on your user name, I'd say your mind is alreayd made up?"
4259,"Lexus ES is front wheel drive, whereas the other three are RWD-based, or AWD if you choose such.  That makes a big difference in handling on ramps and corners.  Lexus is Camry-based, but I would not say it's just a Camry, because that's not really fair.  However, it will definitely share some characteristics with its common sister."
4260,"Thank you cdnpinhead, stickguy, graphicguy, dino001 for your input."
4261,Looks like a Lexus fits your bill.
4262,"I think you should look at the Acura TL.  It's front wheel drive like the Lexus, gets excellent MPG, rated very high reliability and low maint especially if you plan on keeping it a long time(which you indicated).  The German cars will no doubt cost you more time and money after you get out of warranty time and miles.  If you have to deal with snow the Lexus and TL being FWD will be a little better for traction.  The Acura TL also comes in a AWD version but based on your stated use and not caring that much about the handling I wouldn't recommend it as it is heavier, get less MPG and cost several thousand more.  Why pay for it if you're not really going to use it.  The Germans are all RWD with AWD being optional but if you have to contend with a lot of bad weather and snow you would probably need the AWD which, again, raises the price and lowers the MPG."
4263,"Thanks m6user.  I did try out the Acura TL also.  It did not feel as smooth as lexus and also felt a little small from inside (compared to lexus).   The controls on lexus were much better also.  I guess, these are the personal things one notices after the test drive.   Overall, I like Acura TL also."
4264,"Yes, the Lexus is a little smoother and bigger inside as it's now based on the Avalon and not the Camry as someone else mentioned.  In fact, if you're not totally immune to a Toyota versus Lexus you might take a look at the Avalon.  From what I saw at the auto show and from what I've read about it, it seems to have an almost luxury class interior and the same drivetrain as the Lexus for about $5-8k less money."
4265,"For work I travel, and rent a lot of cars. Lately I have been renting many Buick LaCrosse's I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with them. They are comfortable, roomy, good power and get decent MPG. The price difference between a Top of the line LaCrosse and ES is about 10K, which is a lot of money. As graphic has pointed out, you are sold on the Lexi, why waste your time looking at other cars when you will have a hard time being objective looking at other cars. However, if you can be objective, the LaCrosse should be one to look at.  BTW, what is your price range you want to spend? Also look at the new Toyota Avalon, again, you will save yourself about 10K."
4266,To Lexus Buyer
4267,"Thanks for your insight dino001.  You are right, I think I am not really looking for the ""P"".   I will test drive the other cars and see what I feel."
4268,"All the other cars on your list are going to be too ""sporty"" for you I suspect. Sporty meaning too small inside, too harsh riding, and/or too noisy."
4269,"the Infiniti would be out anyway due to MPG, smoothness, and back seat.  And no way are you getting that much space out of the 3 series."
4270,"FWIW, the new Avlon-based ES Lexus has a huge amount of rear seat leg room."
4271,"Yes, it does.  I did test drive the lexus and it fit the two booster seat and still comfortable for the third person in the middle."
4272,"Between my wife and I we've owned/leased each of these vehicles over the past say ten years and add to this an Audi A4 and Lexus RX. I'd like to share my opinion on what you have posted, but do encourage you to drive everything you're interested in. Car buying...test driving is fun and vehicles are expensive, so enjoy picking out what you like."
4273,The ES has much more backseat legroom than the A4.
4274,"Fed, I was thinking of the Genesis, but he want FWD, and the Genesis is RWD."
4275,"The Azera is comparable to an ES.  and quite roomy.  Though of course, without the prestige badge!"
4276,"Dino MB is moving away from the Urea Injection finally, BMW will be doing that too. Audi and VW never used it. The Chevy Curze and Mazda 6 wont be needed it either. So this extra maintenance is null issue."
4277,"Don't know where you've been but any late model Accord V-6, Camry V-6, Mazda- V-6, Passat V-6, Impala V-6, Malibu V-6, Acura TL, Buick LaCrosse V-6,  Hyundai and Kia turbo 4s, Altima V-6.  There are probably others.  All of these have around 270 to 300+ HP and all are FWD.  I've driven several of them aggressively and as long as the tires are good and the road is dry they do just fine.  They are heavier than your early SHO of course but they probably would give that Yamaha engine in your SHO a good race."
4278,And the current who is AWD
4279,"While I agree fwd and sport do not always go together modern rigs have computers, better tires, power assisted steering and steer by wire systems that help reduce torque steer. Great example of technology is the new focus St- this is a real deal sporty car that is fwd. (go ford)."
4280,'BMW's front driver is renown for its handling. '
4281,MINI Cooper....
4282,"That's why I said ""don't always go together"" - plus mentioned the ford st."
4283,"At the limit, RWD trumps FWD, but having had 2 BMW 3 series coupes with sport pkg., I'm now driving a 2007 Acura TL Type S and have enjoyed its handling since new."
4284,Acura has good computers to counter act the effects of TS.
4285,"I don't think Mini is considered a BMW, that is like saying that a Rolls Royce is a BMW too."
4286,"Here's the thing, I have owned FWDs that were enjoyable to corner at the limit because they were relatively light (not so much weight to transfer)  but once you start getting much larger than a Golf or Mazda3 you're going to get a lot of weight resisting any transfer of direction.  I'd say a Focus is right on the limit but probably enjoyable to corner much of the time but a Fusion or Accord, not so much."
4287,"Weight of the gti is 3000-3200 lbs depending on doors or options, focus st is 3250."
4288,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this forum. I'm sorry in advance if my question has been discussed before (haven't been able to go through 15000 previous posts yet, but I will)."
4289,"I had an '04 TL and then an '06 and '09 325i and 328i, respectively, among many other cars.  The TL drove admirably well, but not exceptionally.  It felt light and much less planted and confidence-inspiring compared with the two 3-series BMW's.  The Acura developed numerous squeaks and rattles and the leather seats wrinkled and showed wear.  The TL was reliable but with a much more ""hollow"" feel compared to the firm and steady and rock-solid feel of the BMW's.  The interiors of the BMW's, although not the best in the business, wore well and were ergonomic (I happened to like the iDrives I had in each.). While I could ride with others in the BMW for prolonged time without fatigue, for example, the passenger seat in the Acura felt compressed like sitting in a hole or on a commode."
4290,"One thing is BMW has many options and lines.   I would not even touch leatherette interior.  The wood or sport line inlays look so much better than standard silver, it's not even funny.  Sport and M lines have much better seats.  I understand there is also different suspension on M line, not sure about sports.  If you option it right, not just get some base level from the dealer's lot, the car will be different.  The only true downside is the price.  To get ""right"" BMW, not just the badge, you got to pay more than starting price.  Worse, many dealers don't even keep good cars, not to spook buyers with 50k+ stickers.  I looked my dealer's and it seems majority are basic, one two options, not even those designer lines, which trully add nice touches, for a price of course.  Bottom line, if you aren't ready to pay up, you better go with Acura.  The price is simply better, especially if you want to stay well below 50 grand."
4291,"I agree.  The F30 loaner I got was a real disapointment in terms of feedback.  But it was larger and faster than my E91, so for some that's enough.  R&T is probably excaggerating, because all others go same direction, but it may not be as far off."
4292,Welcome to the forum Leoblue.
4293,"With everyone else here.  I'm a big fan of both Acuras and BMWs.  The new edition of BMW 3s (known as F3x series) really are a significant departure from their fun to drive roots.  They're still good driving cars, but to get the premium features you noticed missing, you have to option a 3 up close to $50K."
4294,"From what I have been reading, if you want the BMW experience of old you either have to go with the one series, or with the Cadillac ATS"
4295,"Do you mean to tell me I could have skipped initiation and not gone through all 1,500 posts befor joining?"
4296,"I would skip - ""backwards hat"" comments and anything with leasing when it comes to this page."
4297,"No - at the time, I'm sure you deserved it.  :P"
4298,Do you wear your hat backwards?
4299,My local Shell has Premium at $3.95. Diesel is $4.15.  It's hard to justify the extra for diesel fuel.
4300,"Yeah, Florida too.  Diesel almost never falls below regular, most of the time it stays either above or just below premium gasoline per gallon, probably more often above by 10-20 cents.  It is not available at my Costco station, where I fuel every week (i.e. the effective differential is even higher, as Costco charges less than say Shell or BP).  Considering diesel engines cost more and need more maintenance, the mpg differential needs to be really substantial to offset the fact that I don't like how it drives vs. nice smooth gas engine.  At least 20% better mpg number before I even give it a time of my day."
4301,Diesel in NY and CT are always higher than 93 Octane by
4302,"I fail to see the logic, though."
4303,"But the upfront $3,000 premium would require almost 13 years to break even."
4304,NYcarguy made a good point about this.  You are paying more for a better engine upgrade.  Not that much different on the BMW than paying to go from a 328 to a 335 or a 6 to an 8 on a 5 series.
4305,"Only if you consider diesel a better engine.  Gas mileage is just one part.  To me diesel is not a better engine for a sports sedan overall.  Minivan, SUV,  pickup truck, yes.  Small sedan, sports sedan, convertible, coupe, no.  Just an opinion, of course."
4306,"You beat me to it.  Diesels, especially if they somehow have a manual transmission, are absurdly high on resale value compared to their gas cousins."
4307,"I'll give you the sports sedan engine, as well as sports car, but not the every day sedans, the way the majority of people drive them they wouldn't even notice the diesel engine, except for some very slight noise dig fence, in fact most would prefer the low down torque of the diesel. Even in the ports sedans, in Europe they claim the best 3 series is the 320 d with the six speed manual ( I may not agree either BTW, just stating the Euro Mag's opinion)."
4308,"Rightfully or wrongfully, diesel cars really are little more than niche vehicles here in the U.S.  Not sure why, except diesel fuel, at least in OH, usually runs from 30 cents/gal more than petro....I've seen the delta go as high as 75 cents more for diesel."
4309,"Interesting so the cost difference is only $4/tank between the two, now if you smoke or go to start buck you spend more on your vice than a tank difference. Plus you get 30% better MPG.."
4310,"The break even point all depends on how much you drive? When we were at the VW dealer looking at the Passt, they had a chart that showed the break even point on all their TDI. The average drive drives 15K miles a year for VW the break even point is roughly 4 years, of course the longer you hold the car the more it pays you back."
4311,FN....my low end comparison was between Premium and Diesel.
4312,"There is an extra maintenance around emission systems due to regulations.  Depending on the manufafacturer, it may amount into urea injection tank refills (Mercedes Benz), or some other emission control activities.  It would be best to check with the manufaturer or dealer on the maintenance schedule.  I would not believe everything dealer posts on their sales floor - or to be exact, if they say it's 4 years, it probably is 6 to 8 to break even."
4313,"It still would if you got 25% gas mileage and resale value was high.  If diesel gives you only 10-15% gas mileage boost, not so much.  Also, some ELLPS (not many) may not require premium gas, which would make needed differential even higher."
4314,check out this link - the new diesel engines are vastly more complicated than the old school MB diesels.
4315,Thought you guys might find this interesting....
4316,I wonder if the AMG version of the CLA is also a Front-wheel driver.  It's generally agreed that 200-225 hp is the practical upper limit for FWD.  300HP would be wasted in such an application and result in either excessive wheelspin or constant intervention on the part of electronic traction control.
4317,I am pretty sure (95%) that it is AWD
4318,The AMG version of the CLA will be 4Matic AWD.
4319,andy...I think it's based on a FWD platform with a Haldex AWD addition.
4320,"VW will be bring over TDI version of their Tiguan for 2014, as well as the Audi Q5. Audi has been importing their A3 in a TDI and Quattro for some time. The combined MPG has been in the high 20's to low 30's."
4321,There are many FWD cars with 270-310 hp and I don't think the conditions  you describe are that common or much of a problem.
4322,"Graphic, if your car gets 28 on the high and the diesel gets 39 on the highway, that $8 difference goes away very quickly (BTW the 39 on the high is the low side.)"
4323,"Hey Fed, you make a strong statement in the fact that your 911 ans 318i are sound cars, I think that the car industry push's cars that people MUST have..  I agree, if I was in the market for a Porsche, I would be looking at a used one, much better deal and I would be able to buy one very close to what I want for a much more reasonable price. Last week Rick and I went to North Scottsdale Porsche (the only Porsche dealer in phoenix) and was looking a Diesel Cayenne. Base $56K, however, the 3 on their lot were in the low $80K.  VERY hard to justify those kind off payments, now they had 2, 2009 Cayenne GTS's average price mid $40K, I can deal with those prices... and last 100K miles if taken care of right... Just like most German cars..."
4324,"The math is what the numbers are- nothing more or less its numbers - my math is not my math but actual figures using real world examples- not generalities or random thoughts this is fact.  I am not, for or against leasing but as a younger person with little credit or coin I did infact lease and it was a painless - since 25 I've owned all new cars mainly because I was liquid enuf to deal with the higher payment of a new car. I can see both sides of the coin have value."
4325,Not just Porsche Flightnurse.
4326,"Anyone driven the G35/37x and can compare it to other AWD sedans in snow performance?  Like Audi Quattro, Acura SH-AWD, Subaru symmetrical AWD."
4327,It doesn't take a sophisticated AWD system to be good in snow...
4328,"I second that.  I'm not objecting to people buying/leasing cars often, I actually have done that, too.  I'm definintely not a 10-year holder of a purchased 3-year old car, the longest stint I have done so far was 6 years, I also owned another car until it was 8 years old (I had it for a bit more than 4 years)."
4329,ky.....how'd you do this a.m. driving around?
4330,"Roads were just wet on the ""good"" side of the river, so no issues...   Still have my snows on the BMW...   It's my wife that drives the G37X and she works from home...."
4331,"Good to hear everything is safe in the ""holler"".  No issues up here, either."
4332,"Fed, its simple, because they want the latest and greatest, the ones who much have that are the ones who keep company's like BMW and Audi's alive. Now granted, I will be in the market for a new car soon, I'm running low on my free days from national."
4333,"I don't think those are coming with diesels any time soon.  Wagon will probably be only 328i/xi and GT will be 328i/xi or 335i/xi.  Diesel is not even in new sedan yet, I'm not aware of plans to introduce it there, so it will take years, if at all, to make it to the wagon or GT.  You can hope I'm wrong, of course."
4334,"New wagon just showed up on BMW website.  Only 328 xdrive, but all four trims (modern, sport, luxury and M).  Pretty high starting price ($42.4K including destination.  BTW, what's up with their stupid ""starting at"" with a price without destination?  How can I get one without destination? Don't you hate it when they start off with a blatant lie?)."
4335,"Leasing is more expensive.  I most definitely agree.  In 18 months (yes math majors, for those who care I've had my 328xi for a year already), when the lease is up on my car I'm going to buy (finance).  So in my case, the lease will have worked out less expensive than if I would have bought the car.  There are 2011 328xis out there NOW selling for close to what my lease buyout is (in 18 months)."
4336,"Half of the fun is getting there.  Literally.  I actually went & drove the car for our esteemed host.  My NAV routed me through beautiful, downtown Lodi, NJ.  I think Lodi is Spanish for ""roll 'em up."""
4337,nyc....what a very nice thing to do.
4338,"When I decided to get rid of my Acura, it was for absolutely no good reason other than ""I didn't LOVE it.""  The crummy brakes & lifeless electric power steering had a lot to do with that, but it would have been much more financially responsible of me to have kept it.  Right now I'd have less than 2 years worth of car payments left & a car with 70,000 miles that would easily surpass double that.  I treated myself by leasing my BMW."
4339,'Official' intro tonight:
4340,funny that KY is looking in Jersey.  You mid-west guys seem to be always posting links to good buys on cars that I really want!
4341,"'Ray....I saw that new CTS pics and announcements. That looks pretty tasty. It certainly sounds like it will have the performance chops, too. '"
4342,"Dino, BMW stated that the sedan and wagon will come with a 2L 180hp Turbo diesel. I'm not expecting them until the 2014 MY. You can build a wagon on BMW website currently delivery wont happen until June.  in regards to the GT, I don't see why BMW wont add the diesel to it either again, I'm not expecting it until MY 2014..."
4343,"Look at the screen when playing the podcast.  There is a button that normally shows 1X.  If you tap the button, it changes the speed to 1.5X and the .5X.  I have no idea why the iPhone has this feature."
4344,"Fair enough.  I think that's generally a good news to finally have lower power 4-cyl. diesels available, even if I don't care for them as much as the other guy.  I read of 320d coming in, which finally makes much more sense than the older 335d.  335d was a rocket, but the case for diesel is in its fuel economy and car range, not in racing abilities.  180 hp diesel is definitely a better choice for the market and may even find some good following, as long as they price it correctly.  It will give you a ""feel"" of 220-240 hp gasoline acceleration feel, just shorter in duration, because of rev limits. If the transmission is good, this may be a really good car.  I wouldn't buy one (as long as gas stays around where it is now), but I see why somebody else would."
4345,"Dino was shocked at the short length of this responce- I actually got thru it thank you. Sorry about the nano, Maybe Steve jobs not happy you bought a BMW. Joking, but have you seen the length of some of your posts?   Flight is a good recourse for apple products, leader ads, cvt transmissions and anything that has to do with bmws- so good hands, btw did not get to 5 guys burgers  tonight will tomorrow."
4346,"I do not believe the iPhone does, in fact, I have a 2013 Ford taurus limited with 203 miles on it. Every time I start the podcast it run in 1.5x speed and this is being plugged into the USB port and playing through the radio. I do not have a problem with it is playing through blue tooth audio."
4347,"Dino, when it comes to gas prices, talk about difference in prices. In Calif Diesel is less then Premium unleaded, and with the 30% increase in MPG of diesel over gas, people who understand this will buy them. In Phoenix, currently Diesel is less then regular unleaded, so this means the price difference between Diesel and Premium unleaded is roughly .35/gal.  Now will this stay this way, who knows, but as long as Diesel's price does not exceed premium unleaded by 30% there is a savings. What is the average price of Premium unleaded (PU) and diesel in the tampa area? How much does it cost to fill the tank with  PU and how much would it cost to fill with with the same amount of gallons with Diesel? I'm sure the difference isn't that much but the savings on the diesel would out weight  the cost."
4348,"Good response. Agree- completely- infact a lease in some cases can be a cheaper alternative monthly then a used car- look you can get a bmw 328 for 339 a Month (not a leader ad, it's on BMW commercials). Could prob do better in some markers. Why do you think the great bmw stays in biz- it sells cars to non enthusiasts."
4349,"I agree people can do what they want, but how much goes down on that $329 BMW lease, 3 or 4 thousand? If they have that kind of money to put down on a lease they could just buy a pretty good used car for that, no it won't be fancy, but it would be more financially sound, that said that certainly isn't what they have to do, and they are free to go for the fancy car if they want, it is one of the reasons we live in the area we do, people are allowed to make their own decisions, but they are also supposed to live with the consequences of those decisions, not go blaming someone else for them and ask for handouts.  Anyway I am getting off topics so I am going to stop."
4350,"Scwman- classic responce - my rebut - evenif it's 4k down and that's an if- you get a brand new BMW (with ""free maintence"") for 3 years - and if you are a recent grad and have an entry level job- you don't have to worry about a new transsssion -'or something similar that you would get in a used car- plus you don't have to pay the full nug at pickup. - a good used car that's 5 years old depending on model is a min 10k. Lux cars could be close to 20 or more."
4351,"the BMW leases are usually $3,500 IIRC.  sometimes a little lower.  but rule of thumb, add about $100/month to get a nothing down number.  No longer silly cheap, but often still a good deal."
4352,"well, I used an example, but was not considering a BMW for a new grad.  More like a Civic, Imprezza, or maybe an ILX with a heavily discounted lease."
4353,Look nothing wrong with civic or whatever he can afford- please no 320 BMW - get the civic or tsx or Mini Cooper- the 320 should be reserved for very old people given its weight and displacement and price.'
4354,"pay big money upfront on a lease need to be aware that if the car is totalled, bad things ensue.  Being upside-down when that happens wouldn't be an especially big deal for someone who could actually afford the car, but for those who lease because they can't. . ."
4355,Or you could roll the down payment and tax in a lease and be right side up given a total. Then lease another using the same formula-
4356,"I have no problem if they can afford the payments, as I said they can do what they want, and you did bring up the BMW which is what I replied to, it would be slightly more reasonable to get a new civics or whatever, but that was not what was being discussed here, it was the leasing or purchasing an entry level luxury car right out of college.  Now nobody but the actual person knows what their financial situation is so really we have no business deciding what they should be doing with their money ( as I stated in the my original reply) and the payments on the BMW may be about the same as on the civic ( though with a bigger upfront payment) so why not go for it if you can and want to, but in general it make more sense to have fewer and lower payments to get yourself out of debt before you go adding new debt, of course I agree with the size of many peoples student debt they can't put their lives on hold for twenty years, but a lot of people seem to want it all as soon as they graduate and get into further financial difficulties, I guess all I am saying is they have to make sure they can actually afford what they buy, and that they have to be aware that just because you get a job as a fresh graduate doesn't mean they are going to still have that job in a year or two ( in today's workplace there are very few guarantees) and that they also need to budget savings so they can afford to survive and continue to pay for things in the event they do lose that great first job.  In other words don't live beyond your means, its not just advice for governments it is for all of us."
4357,"Those friends I had, who paid off student loans in just a few years, did not live like paupers.  This forum is about ELLPS, which has word ""luxury"".  Last time I checked the definition, it meant things that are not necessary in life.  Last time I checked the word ""pauper"", it meant somebody deprived of the basic goods and services.  There is world between those two point. A three year old domestic or imported compact car is not beyond dignity of a recent graduate.  Plenty of people live like that and are not considered living like paupers."
4358,"All standard leases include GAP coverage.  Putting money down on a lease is a bad idea, period.  It is usually based on desire to lower payment and projecting what one should do on a loan, where large downpayment is actually a good idea.  The difference is in completely different type of risk in each of those financing schemes.  Loan puts risk of ownership on the buyer, lease puts it on the bank.  So banks will love people putting money down on a lease."
4359,"Dino - I don't like to dispute what you say because you always research before you make your point (and very well I might add), but I think GAP insurance laws vary by state.  I know where I used to live (NY), that GAP insurance is included in every single auto lease & finance contract written in the state.  Where I live now (CT), GAP is something they push on you in the F&I office."
4360,"On the leases or loans?  I never leased, but every article I read about leasing said GAP is now standard with leases.  Perhaps our hosts (kyfdx) could confirm/deny this.  Btw, even if I am right, it will not surprise me if some dealers double sell to uniformed."
4361,"Hey Dino - this is WAAAAY off topic, but I'm going to look at a Saabaru 92X Aero for a friend later today.  Since I know you are a former WRX owner, is there anything that I should be on the lookout for specifically?"
4362,"I liked 9-2x, they were Subarus all the way, but with small value added in (available leather, HID lights, nicer wheels, all on top of the line vs. Subaru did not offer it in WRX, only STI).  The only thing I'd say, only manual transmission is worth the buy.  The auto is an awful antiquated 4-speed, feels like 90s.  No worries on service, any Subie dealer will do it, all mechanical parts and vast majority of interior are identical."
4363,The one I'm looking at is a 5 speed with 70K miles.  It is an Aero (Turbo).
4364,"Exactly.  This one of those classic mental schemes.  Make one look at one number, say it is x per month and forget about anything else that may be associated with it.  This is not just cars, it is a lot of other things, house being most obvious, but also entertainment services, electronics. Always ""only X/month and before you know it, you're in bank chains, paying thousands of interest each year and complaining about student loan from 20 years ago and wondering why it's not paid off."
4365,"Good deal.  Just check the mechanicals, if they're OK, car should be great.  Check the insurance, because I don't know about those body panels availability."
4366,"I love the first post directed at me- then the follow up post that is basically my answer to the first question you ask. Now leader ads are your specialty - but instead of trying to be confrontational lets add some value, do a little research - something - the insurance answer is ""a lot"" just like it would be on a new civic relevant to each selling price."
4367,"Q&D math, 1 more year of payments but after 4 years with the 2009, you are out about $12K, but own the car outright.  With the lease, you are 1 year deep into another set of payments!"
4368,But don't you think living in low payment fantasy world is much cooler?
4369,Q&d math? Don't get that term.
4370,"quick and dirty, meaning I just did it in my head so a little bit ballparked."
4371,"Q&d math - first time I've seen that one for that explanation now i know- wtf, lol and now q&d"
4372,"I bought my Volvo V70 new in 2004 for around $30,000. Paid it off on schedule and haven't had a car payment since 2008."
4373,"And speaking of used cars, my BMW and Porsche both passed their one year anniversary with me!"
4374,"Your math is not correct as Dino and pointed out, the 2009 you own, the 2013 you do not, so in the end, the 2009 is the better deal, once it is paid off, the kid has something that is worth $$."
4375,"""Synthetic oils are superior"" - wow - this is the same blanket statement that the oil guys had to scrap in an ad campaign during the early 2000s because legal and compliance killed it because it wasn't scientific proof. (How do I know this, well the wife worked on Castros campaign)"
4376,"Synthetic are superior on paper, BUT, that one problem is really a giant one, potentially, as it conflicts with the #1 goal of oil, which is to keep the machine from self-destructing.  And Americans are unfortunately not the brightest motorists when it comes to maintaining their vehicles.  Some of us are, but a whole lot do do things like let their car go a year between changes."
4377,So the real advantage of synthetics is to help laziness- got it
4378,"And of course, the oil companies pockets."
4379,The additives are different from brand to brand and dino vs. synthetic
4380,It was a short info article really about the expanded 3 serie
4381,"A reporter would like to talk to someone under the age of 30 who bought a car within the last few months. Please reach out to pr@edmunds.com by Wednesday, March 20, 2013 if you'd like to help."
4382,Wrong forum Steve most of the dudes on this forum are 40+ Haven't driven a manual year
4383,A manual in years - p
4384,See?  Our minds are going already.  We're all a bunch of guys sitting on our porches who rattle on about crud nobody really cares about.   :P
4385,I go to the web site BIMMERFEST.COM fairly regularly.
4386,"Whereas, I hope to have a couple of young kids making $40,000-$50,000 a year that let their father still live with them!"
4387,"Must be the ""backwards hat"" crowd you referenced before going to Siberia for a few weeks. Who cares - BMW and others have low lease rates- this allows the crowd you hate to get the same emblem you drive - it's been going on for 20 years - times change"

4389,"I'm sure that the BMW-owning contributors to this forum own, and drive, them to appreciate the fine German engineering, superb build quality and all-round excellent driving experience; not as status symbols to demonstrate wealth or superiority."
4390,"I spent a good deal of my adult life coming up with reasons not to buy a BMW--not worth the asking price, snotty, pretentious owners, not good in snow etc etc.   I finally succumbed when I stopped by a local independent reseller/service center and saw low mileage E39 Fivers going for about the cost of a loaded CamCord.  I'd driven enough Bimmers to know they were very sweet to drive and I'd known enough owners to know they were well-made so I swallowed my reservations and acquired a 44K mile 528iA.  I still have it 8 years and 100K miles later and I've since bought a 77K mile 330Ci Cabrio."
4391,the only reason I ever came up with was not making enough money to afford it.
4392,Andy....I think you are among the majority.
4393,"Grapghic, I had a good laugh at what you wrote, and the Movie ""Pretty in Pink"" came to mind, perfect back drop of the ""entitled people."" On a side note, I went to school with people who had this attitude, on their 16th Bday went and picked out a new BMW 320i. At that time in my life, BMW's weren't hot on my list of cars."
4394,After you satisfy your college loans - you qualify to buy a used BMW.   Leasing any car while you still owe on your education loans is hypocritical.
4395,Interesting comment....
4396,"And how many doctors file for bankruptcy?  As far as I heard, doctors are just terrible business and finance people (not all of course, but as a social group).  Buying/leasing expensive vehicle while $100K+ in debt is exactly an example one could give to confirm this opinion."
4397,I was hiding my true feelings.
4398,I concur.  A husband and wife in our group fo friends are physicians.  They just paid off their student loans from med school after almost 20 years.  They live in a nice but not ostentatious home.  She drives a Sienna and he an A4.  They live well below their means and are now saving to pay for two more college educations.
4399,just because you have some student loans doesn't mean you have to live like a pauper or drive a junker.

4402,"Sad that GM still has oil/engine problems on the Caddys.  My uncle bought a 2002 DeVille with the dreaded Northstar.  It drank oil and he complained to GM numerous times and was told the oil consumption was ""acceptable"" and they refused to do anything about it.  He now drives an Infiniti and will never consider GM again, and I can't say I blame him."
4403,"The CTS doesn't have oil issues from a design standpoint.  What is happening is that people need to learn that with an oil life monitor and synthetic oils, that the gauge usually will be telling you how much life/protection is left in it."
4404,"If 0% trully means zero protection, the designer of CTS should be fired, because it's a poorly designed messaging system.  It should be such that ""zero"" means ""change now"", because that's how normal person would understand the message.  I trully doubt that is how it's designed."
4405,"The CTS owner's manual for 2013 shows that when the ""Change Engine Oil"" soon comes on, it should be changed with 600 miles and that the oil showed by changed at least once a year."
4406,"I think that, too.  Can't imagine it any other way, really."
4407,have engine lunching issues that have to do with excessive oil consumption that starts suddenly.
4408,Does this issue effect other cars at gm using the same motor - ?
4409,"""lunching issues that have to do with excessive oil consumption"""
4410,Hey Dino -
4411,"Yes, they do.  By law, American market cars have to have lights aiming unevenly, biased to the right.  You could see it in xenons because they are so bright, but the same is with regular lights - that is, unless people tamper with their settings, which I see done a lot.  Some guy thinks he can't see, so he ratchets the up, blinding everybody else."
4412,"I would amend that it is left lights that should aim lower, not right.  The idea is reduction in glare for the oncoming traffic and better vision for the sidewalk/shoulder pedestrians or small vehicles."
4413,"Cool.  Thanks.  So my left light is aimed too high.  When I use the high beams, they are even."
4414,Or perhaps your right light is aimed too low?
4415,Might be something to monitor if you are looking to go back at GM about a product fault- if it's an engine issue it should not be isolated to the Cts- and would effect other brands under the umbrella- just food for thought.
4416,2012 3.7L V6 Acura engines didn't come with synthetic oil.  Of course the dealer will sell it to you -- but if you don't ask you will get non-syn when the oil change indicator comes on (which is at 15%).
4417,"Yeah, I had same thoughts.  The comment on synthetic simply didn't add up to me either.  Knowing that European brands/models and all other brands marketed across the Pond (that includes GM, Ford, Honda et al.) come with synthetic-only maintenance with intervals 12-20 thousand miles, depending on the brand (they did that about a bit less than 10 years ago).  You have to use specific brand (or approved brands), or you void your warranty, but the idea is to cut into number of visits in garages.  Seems it didn't catch up in the US because the dealers would rather see you four times per year, so they can always find something to do.  In exchange, you get cheapest oil they can buy, but since you change it every three months, it doesn't matter that much (in their mind anyway).  It would be an outrage if customers suddenly stopped coming just because the oil got better and doesn't need to be changed, wouldn't it?  Not in this country, we don't allow things like that."
4418,"I always thought synthetic was only useful for engines that 'used' it; akin to premium fuel...only engines that ran hot (turbo's, etc) benefited.  The life of the oil wasn't necessarily greater."
4419,Oil commentary from edmunds- yes edmunds
4420,"I would have to check the manual, but I assumed my Acura (2013 RDX with the 3.5l) used semi-syn.  I know my 2007 Volvo S40 uses that (I asked when I took it in for the first time last year)."
4421,Or you could read this
4422,And... nothing in that article is counter to what I was saying.   :P
4423,"Obviously.  This also affected Porsche, Mazda (RX-8), the Honda S2000, and several other cars with high revving engines.  Conventional oils simply couldn't take the punishment.    And as engines get to be smaller and higher revving, with more turbos in the mix, you'd need a synthetic blend as a minimum."
4424,Wasn't saying it was a counter- just a really short and quick and easy to read- btw I posted this before your post as a general information for those who care.
4425,Because his two neighbors didn't think to do it so he extrapulates that out to the entire U.S. population and considers it fact as usual.
4426,Haha guess I was looking more then a neighbor and his one tsx experience.
4427,"Sweeny, really you have no idea why they have different buyers. Basically the difference between Honda and Acura is that Acura is the upscale division or builder of luxury cars and Honda is builder of economy cars. Having the middle class buyer isn't looking at the Accord and TXS. Now if you can show me I am wrong, direct me to the data."
4428,"You are right - I don't know why - that's why I asked the question, which you were quick to answer with ""because they don't"" then you backed up that insight with your friend didn't cross shop it - and that was presented as fact.  I don't have the data because - thus"
4429,Too funny.  All we are saying is that some people do crossshop like that based  on our experience in response to your huge survey of a couple of friends and coming up with a definitive statement that nobody does.
4430,"There may not be a large overlap in Acura vs Honda buyers, but as long as prices overlap, there will be.  Some people look at what they can spend first and then they have large flexibility on what they can buy.  I'm one of those.  O don't look at brands, or labels, I look at what's there.  When I was buying my '03 WRX, I cross shoped it with Passat wagon.  According to your creed I shouldn't be allowed because they're different cars addressed to different people - I don't care.  When it's time for my 328 to go, my next car may be anything between Ford Focus and 5-series.  Am I allowed to shop like that?"
4431,"I feel you and yr smart to recognize it! It's the only way for Mercedes to compete with lexus, and Acura! A Kia has way more features!"
4432,"Here is a perspective -- I have no proof that this is any more than an anecdote.  I suspect, however, the following perspective probably is a data point, therefore of some statistical significance."
4433,"I see your way of buying, but it's not for me.  I NEVER leased and it is not likely I will start any time soon.  This may be a function of cars I have bought and continue to like.  Subaru doesn't subsidize their leases much (residuals tend to be close to market value, they sometimes lower the money factor), even the 328i I bough last year (wagon) had lease with MF way too high for my taste.  After I factored 15K miles/yr I need (perhaps a bit less, but not much), all the extra fees that come with the lease, lease was not even close to be considered. It was something like 5 yr. loan at below 3% or three year lease with extra fees and equivalent MF around 5% (after conversion to interest rate) - and the residual wasn't awesome, either. No can do in my book.   If I were getting a sedan or coupe, sure - lower MF would compensate for higher fees."
4434,"Interesting take- thank you. I can def see the reason to go  ""up"" if the price is right. And In the case of the TL vs the A4 we are talking 3600 bux of real dollars on a car you do not even own, assuming a 36mth lease- real money."
4435,I leased a 2013 CTS sedan in Dec so far I have been very happy with it I have about 700 miles on it I am still learning about it would due again
4436,What model? Options ? What's your opinion on the car?
4437,"Note that the oil life indicator is German and is precisely what it says it is.  That is, it tells you how much protection the oil has left in it.  When it hits 0, it's not time to change it.  It's essentially turned into water and you're damaging the engine. (0% protection left)"
4438,"Dont know what you call precise but my 2009 awd is precise as they come, most manufacturers are moving away from the hydro to electric."
4439,"Glad to hear you're enjoying your CTS, tommy42! Let us know if you have any questions about the operation of the vehicle - we're happy to help as much as we can!"
4440,"It's not the ""typical Camry LE buyer"" that I believe is looking at an ES.  It the absolutely loaded Camry V6 XLE buyer that is looking at the almost $34k MSRP.  They think maybe they can get in a base ES for similar money but they would have to give up some bells and whistles like NAV, JBL etc.  The base ES is $36995.  So there is only a"
4441,The engineer involved with the algorithm of the Oil Life Indicator was a poster on the Caddy Info site back around 2002 - 2003. He stated that the Oil Life Indicator has a built in protection factor for the engine once you hit 0% oil life. I change my oil at about 10% oil life left and my CTS has been running great for almost 11 years.
4442,"You must be lucky, then, because many many people have had their engines dump their oil into their cat via blown gaskets by waiting until it reads 0.  In fact, the official advice (NOW) from the GM dealership mechanics nationwide is to change synthetic oil at 6K miles."
4443,Interesting that you would go with the Camry LE as a example- and not the closer top end model that we have been talking about all along- a mainstream car at a price level that would make you think about a jump up- or a lux car like the tsx that would make you look at a accord touring (which is a shade less then tsx tech) and has more features.
4444,"Haven't seen him, love that cat"
4445,"If we are talking main stream cars, then the LE is the model to talk about, since the LE outsells any other Camry. Yes, if someone was looking at a top of the line XLE camry then the next jump would be the Avalon and think the base price of the base Avalon is $1K less then a fully loaded XLE. The ES base price is higher then a fully loaded XLE. Lexus err Toyota has done a great marketing job on Lexus, people are willing to pay more for the lexus name. BTW, a fully loaded ES is more than a fully loaded Avalon."
4446,The point of the agreement as I stated before was price - not specific Toyota model sells the best- I think you know this- if a person is looking at 22k car ofcourse they are not going to step up.  - it's also not Lexus specific to Toyota - as stated before.
4447,"While gassing up my 328xi last night, a guy pulls up behind me in an F30 328xi Sport Line.  He noticed me checking out his car & I asked him how he liked it.  He told me the car was ""nice,"" but ""way too soft.""  He liked the way his old 330Ci coupe drove much better."
4448,What is Panamerica?
4449,"You are SO right about the car nomenclature.  Everything in Lincoln is a ""Mark"" (MK), and all Caddy's are ""touring sedans""."
4450,"Continentals and DeVille's are synonyms with old people and both GM and Ford do not want anything to do with that. Lincoln was always the sporty of the FMCo luxury divisions.  Now, many people could make an argument about  this that both Continentals and DeVille's made sporty/stylist cars. However, it appears that both companies have decided to go down different roads."
4451,"If I bought a new caddy , I would get an old school emblem from a deville or cineron - and slap that to the back, but i would not haphazardly do this - make it look good- would also consider a couple of headrest TVs.  I miss car names as well."
4452,I wonder what will 'trickle down'
4453,"I read the test report, today in USATODAY on-line, of the new Acura RLX.  The price came in at $61,000.  The thing is, this was a front-wheel-drive version and it was noted that the AWD version wouldn't be here 'til fall and that the way the thing got to AWD would be by the addition of two electric motors one each driving a rear wheel.  Comment was that this would add complexity and cost (and a heavy battery pack.)"
4454,"I would wait to see reviews on the RLX after it is out a year before buying it.  Acura's key cars hace been the TSX, TL, and its SUV's.  Not sure why they are have this model in the line-up.  Infiniti finally got rid of the Q45 as it did not sell, and marketed the G and M series successfully."
4455,"I agree one should wait on an Acura product but not due to quality but to performance because the current line (awd TL included) is a dog and has been since the tsx and TL redues - it's amazing how long they have gone without producing a solid exciting sedan- the mdx is in what it's 6th year in current form and by far it's best product- but I've been saying this for years. Yes Infiniti hit it right with the first g, the second even better- coupe convert and awd right in the form of what they are chasing - & somehow offering much more at price (dollar for dollar even the biggest BMW lover could not disagree) - they did it right lets hope the new q50 continues this but I will miss the g name. Dk much about the M or its impact- sure its a nice car but even as an Infiniti fan has it left a real mark? I don't know."
4456,"Well look at the sales numbers and tell me they are not a dog. I would look again, now styling asides, and terrible by most accounts,  BMW audi and Infiniti (don't dk about lex) make better cars then then TL. The tsx is a nice accord alternative but not a better car for thr price."
4457,"Acura seems to make good quality cars.  They are solid vehicles, but honda has never been about being stylish.  Initially when the M sedan came out it appears it was very popular.  The recent generation M took a hit with its looks and transmission problems."
4458,"I know it isn't a luxury nameplate, but this"
4459,"NYCAR, GM has tried this many times and have failed, last time was with the G8. For this car to be successful, GM has to make sure that the car is screwed together correctly, and have a premium feel to it. The price is right thought."
4460,"For the price it's an alternative, right? Same engines. Leather , parts., larger cheaper, newer -"
4461,"I used to be as anti GM as they come.  In my eyes, they've really done a complete 180 compared to the garbage they put in the showroom in the '80s, '90s, & the better part of the '00s."
4462,"In my daily dealings I have had people like the design of the prior M generation than the current one.  The same can be said of the prior QX56 and newest design.  I was almost going to lease the M37, but multiple issues with the transmission shifting prompted me to stay away.  I am still a fan of the M37 and compare it to the E class MB and BMW 5 series."
4463,"I like the M too, however, for the price I think a 5 series is a better car. The price for a M56 is slightly less (1,500) then a 550i. I'd take the twin turbo V8 over the INfiniti V8, and a 550i can be had with a manuel, something the infiniti lacks. The E class is not a sport sedan unless you look at the AMG model."
4464,If price is inline - why would they not shop accord vs tsx? Both have a 4 and a 6 engine - both are Hondas and both can be had with leather- both are fwd. To me it doesn't make sense not to cross shop.
4465,BMW alert another recall- recall they had a massive recall last year as well.
4466,The E sedan comes with sports mode as standard.  Front and rear tires diferent sizes which is a pain when replacing them.  I agree the AMG package is the true sports package.  With me it came down to M37 vs E350 with the tranmission issues swaying me to the MB.  I have never been able to get a good deal on any BMW vehicles from the local dealers.  I have had the infinitiQ45 loved this vehicle and prior generation QX56 also a great vehicle.
4467,"Sweeny the Honda and Acura have different buyers, this is why someone wouldn't cross shop the Accord and TSX."
4468,I would like to know why they have different buyers?
4469,"Dino I think we are getting away from the original post that you stated, to something about not being able to find a base model on the lot. The price of $37,055 is really a base model with one thing added which is a aftermarket nav system, that integrates with the radio, just like the OEM nav system. It's a pretty slick system, so with the base price + shipping the car is $36,255, then add the nav system $800, this is how you get the $37,055 price.  So it is possible to get a base C250, and the dealer I posted has many of them."
4470,"I'm an options fool, too.  I don't buy those over the top stuff (like adaptive cruise control or lane departure thing) unless it is part of a discounted package.  I am complete agnostic of wheels (never really understood why people care so much) and often would even prefer smaller rims, as they gove you more comfort, plus those really low profile tires look just stupid, IMHO. However, I want most items related to convenience, safety and sports suspension.  I would not touch 3-series without their sports seat (their std. seats are terrible), I a fool for xenons and trully like the swiveling aspect of them.  I'm a fool for a sunroof, fortunately it was standard on my wagon (and bigger, too).  Parking sensors, keyless entry/start - yes please, especially that it was offered in one big package with two or three other things.  Navigation - first I didn't want it, then they dropped the price by about $600 (they actually dropped the price of premium package, when it was combined with nav), so I took it.  I like the screen, I like the routing, I despise the POI search (totally subpar in comparison to Garmin).  Voice control came with it, doesn't work very well, especially in addresses (1 out of 5)."
4471,"I had '03 WRX and later '08 STI.  I live in Florida, similar to Tx.  I loved them.  The fun is on ramps, tight corners.  The neutral feel in the middle of the turn and ""forgiving"" nature is unbeatable. The 03 WRX didn't have traction control, but I never needed it, even in big rain, even when tires got a bit worned out.  It gave me plenty of warning and self correction just by easing on throttle.  I have a RWD 328 now.  I love it, too.  It is different, but it is not as neutral, especially on corner entries.  I love to hit the throttle half way through the turn, but it is classic ""slow in/fast out"" scheme.  AWD gives you ability to come in too fast and still correct in the middle, keep the control and come out of the turn in decent terms."
4472,"You are correct and I'm sorry, it was Billperksii who wrote that no one would find a base car on the lot.."
4473,"I also assumed it was the ""internet"" price too which it wasn't it is a base care with an aftermarket Nav system that was designed for C230 and other MB for 2013."
4474,"Understood.  If anything, I see the similar trend in stock of my local dealership.  Vast majority of C250s they have there are low-option level between 37 and 40 grand MSRP.  Moreover, there is very little stock of C300 or C350 lines. If you are an options fool (like I am), you would actually have a hard time to find C250 with the goodies. Very few cars with leather (MBTex seems to rule there), sports pack, some have premium pack, but unlike BMW, Benz charges for leather on top of premium pack."
4475,"No, I'm almost sure those are all MSRPs.  The math and pictures seem to support it (standard wheels, standard seats, standard interior).  You get to 37-39K levels when you take bare bones and add couple of small options (metallic paint, some accessories, etc.), or one package (like premium for 2500)."
4476,Talking about pricing and packaging - most chatter I've ever seen about this rig on these channels- no one is talking about what you really get with this 37k MB- a weak engine and sub group performance - I guess you do get the keys with the star on it - you get to walk into a dealership with 100k cars around.  I still can't wrap my head around German premium car companies charging for leather on any car.
4477,"I feel your pain, brother"
4478,"dino....I always seem to look at Benzes when I'm in the market.  That's about as far as I get given they really aren't all that sporty of a drive (until you get into the really high buck AMG versions).  And, I try to understand the allure of them."
4479,FN.....good point.  I guess the lux marks see gold to be mined where Accords and Camry sometimes play.
4480,Camry and accord comment - true pricing might be the same- but again how can we call these cars Elpps- they don't offer much lux in standard form and performance is less then the mentioned accord.
4481,"This is a great question, so would you buy a Acura ILX or a fully loaded Camry?"
4482,"Sweeny the typical buyer will not understand what ELLPS means and they really do not care. Most buyers buy by monthly payment, and if they can afford a Camry XLE with all the bells and dodad's then they will buy it. Why do you think that most dealership bring out that ""worksheet"" and ask you what you want to spend a month."
4483,"FN.....I can't even remember the last time I drove a Camry....at least 2-3 generations ago.  And, I've never driven an ILX.  So, not sure if I can answer your question."
4484,"Graphic,  I believe the CLA will get the AMG treatment, which will give it some performance. I agree that the CLA will bring a whole new type of customer to MB, just like GT-R brought a whole different buyer to the Nissan Dealer.  Lots of changes happening and it will be interesting to see how the dealers will change."
4485,the real question though is if the CLA will be grounded to the ground.
4486,"""hat backwards crowd?"" - how they are handled by the dealers...throw in the Altima story and we have a red flag."
4487,"Sorry, but just because a car has leather, some bells and whistles and MSRPs at the very low end of the ELLPS price range does not put it in a luxury category nor does it put it in a performance category.   I don't believe anybody that buys a Fusion, Camry, Accord or Passat with a V6 and leather believe they are bying a luxury car just because the price overlaps the bottom of the ELLPS.   They just know they are getting all the NAV, big sound, leather etc and realize if they wanted all that in a real luxury car they would be paying north of $40k, not north of $30k.  +"
4488,"So what is the ""official"" definition that _we_ must follow M6 of what is a ELLPS?  Are you the grand Car Czar to tell us what models are and are not ELLPS? Or are the manufactures the one who do it?"
4489,"No need to get your shorts in a twist.  I absolutely am not saying I make the decisions.  I kind of think the list at the top of this page does a decent job based on real data which I believe is based on consumer feedback and NOT on someones arbitrary opinion.  I'm just saying that non-luxury makes don't pretend to be luxury so why should we put them in that category just because the top of line in their bread and butter cars cross slightly over into the absloute bottom of the ELLPS prices.  Toyota makes the Lexus and calls it their luxury car and provides the warranty, service, dealership experience to go along with it.  They don't market the Camry as luxury....they market it as value."
4490,I saw my first Caddy ATS (outside of an Auto Show).  IMO it's the best looking car they make.  This one was Metallic Pearl White (a color that does not favor most cars).
4491,"Pretty cool from the pix I've seen I like as well with big wheels- also think (and seen) the largest caddy, forgot the name- is a looker as well."
4492,"Interesting I would place the Hyundai Genesis V8 is the category that you are saying. Hyundai is a Econ brand car company, however, owning one now for a while, I can tell you it is ever bit a luxury car.  It's not a ELLPS, I would classify it as a ELLC (Entery Level Luxury Car.) It doesn't have the refinement of a E class however (but pretty darn close), the price difference is $25K too."
4493,"The problem I see with this CLA & every other car in this class is the 29,900 starting price.  Add 4 matic, Navigation, Xenon Headlights, Distronic Cruise Control, sunroof, nice wheels... Like they'll have them loaded up on the auto show floors & in the showroom & $29,900 becomes $45K+ very quickly."
4494,Turbo 4cyl
4495,"The 29K is a bit misleading...but it is the actual ""Starting At"" price."
4496,Yeah- try finding a base car on any dealer lot.
4497,Voice of reason- nice - ellps should have some lux features built into the standard price- Acura does a nice job with standard features - the Germans not so much-
4498,"Totally agree- the basic options (leather, Lights, heated seats) are standard on the Japanese brands."
4499,"I agree with you that there is nothing wrong with ""normal"" cruise control.  I just stated that because MB touted Distronic in their ad."
4500,"... is fold-down rear seat.  I think for BMW or Benz to demand $500 for it on sedans is a true scandal and I'm shocked they are getting away with it.  What's worse, many dealers actually do not order this option, so I can bet there are many trully surprised owners of 3-series, who discover their seats don't fold down first time they try to put something bigger into their trunk."
4501,Good Luck to those purchasers of 37k C250- as another poster would say Happy Motoring.
4502,"It is impossible that those 37K-39K Benzes have leather.  According to MBUSA.com, to add leather seats ($1750), you have add premium package ($2500), which means even without metallic color ($720), you have to add $4250 to sticker, i.e. price HAS TO cross 40 grand to get leather.  The MBTex looks like leather, but it is not.  Many dealers are just terrible in car descriptions on their websites. All they give you is price, colors and list of standard equipment, which they call  ""options"", probably to confuse you.  Or perhaps they don't undertand meaning of word ""option"".  Assuming some low level secretary inputs the data, it is possible, I suppose. BMW, MB and Volvo dealers are worst when it comes to description of their stock.  At least those from my neck of the woods.  Surprisingly, Cadillac dealers show exact descriptions of their stock, including package/option codes and everything.  The lower you go in brand, the better it gets. All Ford, Toyota, GM, websites are great when it comes to accurate stock description. Go figure."
4503,So msrps on Germans are misleading because you dk what exactly is in the said car. Interesting. I just went to the acura website- and they have 5 different ilx models - they come as they come no real options to speak just dealer accessories - same with the TL (6) and Tsx(5). Btw if the new mb 1 series is Ellps then so is the ilx.
4504,"Dino this is the description the dealer has for the less expensive C250 which is priced at $37,055.  Is this internet price???"
4505,"Do we need to change the list? I see Acura TL, TSX - if the TSX is the entry car, why is TL on the list? I see BMW 3 but not BMW 1. I see Caddy CTS but no ATS."
4506,There's a limit to the number of vehicles we can list.  The current list represents vehicles that people search for most often on our site (or search for on Google and end up in forums).
4507,I have this going one another forum and thought I would bring this to a more universal sight too.
4508,AWD in Texas?
4509,"I don't know.  All I saw on the website, if you took least expensive C250 starting at $35350, but not really because there is non-optional $905 manufacturer's ""transportation charge"", i.e. it REALLY starts at $36,255 MSRP (that is case of deceptive advertising, but it's a different story).  Then any time you wanted to add leather, it required also a premium package, which in turn moved the price to 40+ grand.  Your quoted car seems C250 Sport Sedan ($36,580) with standard 5-twin spoke wheels (for that line) and $475 worth of options, which ain't much - perhaps it is some snap-on navigation they mention.  I do not think it is an internet There can be small discrepancies, as car prices change over the year.  Definitely no leather - MB Tex (high quality polymer) is standard seat surface.   No, this car does not have $2500 ""sports package"", it is C250 Sports Sedan.  There is a difference, but the dealer probably doesn't know it (or pretends not to know it)."
4510,"S4 is best choice for fun, but in spite of being CPO, I would keep some good money on the account.  If you have the money go for it.  If you look for some low payment type of deal, or are not prepared to spend more on the car than just buying price, go for Infiniti."
4511,"I can afford the car, and maintenance. I just don't want the car to be rumplestiltskin and force me to offer up my 1st born."
4512,"As long as you are prepared, S4 is the one I's choose."
4513,"I also agree the b8 is one hell of a machine- as others have mentioned audis in general love the shop, and costs are high if you get a runt. They are real performers but please get one with a manual- the autos are fine but this car should be reserved for the enthusiasts."
4514,"tlong.....you and I have the same taste in cars.....TLs, Audis, BMWs."
4515,"Flight did you do any research on the answer, come on guy."
4516,"I would have to pick the acura over the other cars. I currently drive an 11 Genesis sedan but, also own a 2000 Acura 3.2 tl. I bought the Acura new in 2000 and currently have 235k on the odometer. This vehicle has been strictly maintained by the Acura dealer and still runs as well as the day I bought it. I have had no major issues with the car. I have all the necessary services performed and the oil changed every 5k miles. Only downside to the Acura is that it run on premium fuel. Other than that, it is a very good car. This car is still quick and will outrun and outperform a lot of cars. Resale value is also very good on Acura's."
4517,"Your responding to a post from aug 2011, wonder if that cat has decided yet?"
4518,"I have a 2000 3.2TL also, but with ""only"" 167K on it.  and like you, always dealer maintained, and nothing major (knock wood), just stuff like an alternator.  Still runs very well."
4519,"Was not a seed yet in the 50s- and good to hear the old TsX is holding up well- Honda does make good cars, most people who I'm related to all have Hondas and they seem to be very happy with them- my wife's crv has been very good as well."
4520,"Opps, I was wrong,"
4521,"Yep not the first time - understand the BMW love but let's be real, one time. Love opinions but have to be fact based- leasing numbers, o-60 times, pricing, transmission talk - it's black and white. Can't wait to meet you at the 5 guys near Jacob Jarvis march 29th."
4522,"Hey- I might join you guys, is the 29th the last day of the show?"
4523,"Sweeny there is more to a car than 0-60 and if you want to talk about leases, BMW has one of the highest resale value. What is funny, many people here including yourself posted how the ATS V6 was faster than the 335i, which all car mag have disproved.  The thing that makes a BMW a BMW is how all the parts work together,  just as they do in a Porsche. In many GM cars, including the ATS and C6 Vette, there is some disconnect."
4524,Will touch on a couple of PTs here- Q50 we have no idea if this car is good at all because it has yet to be driven- infact the specs have not been formed - is it going to have a 4 cyl at some pt. performance numbers and pricing?
4525,"I go every year on Easter Sunday.  Get there at 10:00 AM when the doors open.  By the time I'm ready to leave @ 12:30 - 1:00, it starts to get super crowded."
4526,"Well I would agree that there are no test reports pertaining to the Q50 -- or if there are, I can't find them or don't have the time to look."
4527,"Q50 is bigger than G, 50 seems also quite a high number (by their own new naming strategy, it is about half way between 10 and 99).  I'd bet there is a model below this one, (Q30?) coming (smaller size, engine would give them better fuel economy credits and some ability to capture market segment below current G).  If so, Q50 may be priced much higher than you think.  Everything is going up.  If 320 can be priced at 45 grand (with options), who knows where this can go."
4528,"Dinio I would agree that the Q50 is going to be higher in price, and that a smaller car will be placed under the Q50. Something like 1 series or A3. Now in regards to pricing of the 320i, a fully loaded 320i is $46K, Nav is a stand- alone option on the car, I would guess that most people would go for a 320i with Premium package, and Nav, which is 40K. But you can get a 320i well equipped for under 40K,"
4529,"According to Infiniti's web page, the drive-train of the Q50 is a carry over, so performance should be able the same, maybe a little faster or a little slower."
4530,Priced MUCH HIGHER?
4531,"I'm still struggling to get over those new prices.  I mentioned that already, but 320i sedan, if comparably equipped, would be priced HIGHER than my E91 328 wagon, with couple of (small) things even missing.  Basically, 60 hp or so less, less metal, cheaper interior, pay the same.  I dread the day pricing of new 328i wagon will be released (I assume it will be 328, not 320).  I suspect it will start in low 40s shooting to something like 55 grand after putting same equipment, as my current one."
4532,According to other sources they will expand the offering to include some Mb parts- as noted here...
4533,mark....I think a point can be made that at least the 328i and the 335i motors are WAY underated as far as power is concerned.
4534,"Dino it is all relative, when I bought my 330i and the price I paid compared to what a new 335i is. But as we all know prices goes up and not down.  So the new 3 series wagon is bigger then your's and the biggest complaint with the E90 was rear passenger room, and the 2013 wagon will have more room.  I'm hoping that the wagon will come in RWD and AWD, I haven't gotten any conformation on it, which is odd, as I'm sure the final product has been approved."
4535,"Graphic here in Phoenix the infiniti dealers have been taking $4500 off most G37s, maybe this is how they are selling so much, lets just discount them to a point that it makes sense to lease one over a BMW or Audi."
4536,"So yes, it is relative.  You expect prices to go up.  But one expects also quality to at least remain, if not improve.  I do not see this in new 3-series."
4537,"A lot of information here, for those who care:"
4538,Wow imagine if you just signed a deal to buy a 57k automatic 335x - I'm sure that cats accountant would be pissed.
4539,"Having owned infiniti vehicles in the past, I always like to see and test drive the new vehicles when they come out.  I recently looked at the JX this past December.  For the money the inetrior and options were great.  The drive was very sluggish without any guts.  About 2 years ago looked at the M37 with interior and options great, but transmission did not shift well.  Test drove the QX56 great pickup and great vehicle.  Based on infiniti's trend the inside of the Q50 showed be very appealing.  My concern is how it will drive as I am concerned about the transmission, only a test drive will answer that question.  I find one cannot compare Japanese vehicle to German vehicle.  They are very different and both have its positives and negatives."
4540,I actually like this one....
4541,It's FWD biased so it'll be dismissed here....
4542,I'll be at the ny auto show as well- need to check out the new Infiniti- prob get mine ordered while I'm there .  They have a tasty 5 guys near there - we can meet up.
4543,I'll be at the ny auto show as well- need to check out the new Infiniti- prob get mine ordered while I'm there .  They have a tasty 5 guys near there - we can meet up. I'm going on the Sunday.
4544,"The wagon will still be sold as 328i, I believe.  I may be wrong about that, though."
4545,I looked closer and it seems it's getting stranger by a minute.  320i uses 2 liter turbo with 180 hp
4546,"I know, it is the tuning.  But it seems to me, such move will be justifiable, if fuel economy gains are substantial.  So far, they are ""TBD""."
4547,Tick a fair share of option boxes & a 335 quickly approaches the mid - upper $50K price tag.
4548,Yeah it's official - it's jumped the shark- BMW 3 series no longer Ellps -hosts please remove it from the right hand column and add another acura.
4549,Buying out my E90 at the end of it's lease seem like a better & better idea;)
4550,"Partly it is lack of competition, and partly it is because they are some of the best cars in their classes for fuel economy, and I think I am responding even though your comments are probably for Dino. I am a diesel supporter and think the market has been suppressed, I think that if there were more offerings we would probably have around 20-25% of the market being diesel, therefor the current 2% is unrepresentative."
4551,"Sween, I'm afraid the competition will keep up (in terms of pricing).  Everything is getting more expensive. Loaded Ford Focus is getting close to 30 grand on the sticker, same goes for many other compacts, loaded Accord crosses 30 grand in a snap, Lexus raised the sticker for its hatchback hybrid by three grand or so without clear increase in its content (don't know too much about this vehicle to say, but saw a headline), so why wouldn't BMW want to charge 40+ grand for its detuned entry level 3-series with couple of options?  I bet Infinity will soon come up dreadful with G25 replacement, which will be opportunity to ""reset"" pricing for it and G37.  Even Acura with its traditional value approach, made a move down, but mostly by rebadging and redressing Civic, which I would hardly call an attractive ELLPS. However, ILX is an opportunity to move prices on next TSX up (provided they will they keep the car, I sure hope so)."
4552,"Told you so year ago, didn't I?"
4553,"$63k for a 414hp 8,400 rpm M3 coupe is beginning to look like real bargain."
4554,"Flight,"
4555,I was checking out the website at the local BMW dealer recently.  Some nice 2010s (maybe 11s also?) and the service loaners looked like a particularly good deal.
4556,"Stickguy, I resisted the siren call of BMWs for most of my adult life because new ones always seem just a bit too expensive.  I passed up on the 2002s, 320is and the wonderful E90s until one fine day I stopped in at a BMW reseller near my office and priced second-hand E39s."
4557,"Simple you have the money to spread around multi dealership trying to decided what you want to buy, we all get that. There are people who can not, so that is why turner companies are out there and have done very well. Dinan works with BMW, anytime Dinan does any work, whether it is stage 1 suspension kit or supercharger kit, the VIN # is sent to BMW. The failure rate for Dinan engine work is very low, about the same as BMW themselves. So having an Dinan or just go to your local BMW dealer and buy a B7 from ALPINA. Turners today are the what they were 20 years ago, I would only work with turners who have a working relationship with the manufacture, i.e Dinan."
4558,Funny but a loaded ford focus could have a boatload more tech then a 180 hp BMW- and also be cheaper and very close in performance -
4559,"I didn't disagree that Dinan is one of the best, most reputable tuners around.  And they can be a relatively good bang for the buck in performance.  I simply restated what they stated on their website: asking more out of a smaller engine will besult in more engine wear.  So my take is that somebody that is very performance minded, goes to the track on occasion or regularly and doesn't care about shaving some life off the second 100,000 miles on the engine, the Dinan option is a viable one.  But for those that are counting on the car being a daily driver for 8-10 years and do not want to take the risk of Dian's admittedly increased engine wear, might think twice."
4560,"oh, if I get one, it for sure will be used."
4561,"You had to say ""I told you so?"" :P"
4562,"You probably could have sold your wife on that used X3, if she didn't test drive her RDX."
4563,"If I buy a coupe, I can go as late as 2012 on a BMW, and still get the straight six....   So.... buy one of those in 2016 and drive it for six years... that gets me to 64 yrs old..."
4564,That's the way to look at it!
4565,"I might have had her on the X3, but she really wanted new and the one we saw had some scratches on the interior console or some such.  Nitpicking, but she really wanted brand new.  She also noted that it had about the same miles as her Odyssey, so what was the point?  The point of course was I could get a slightly used 3 series too, but that was not for her!"
4566,"kyfdx....I've got a cherry '11 335 ix Coupe with the Performance Pack.  It has your name written all over it, if you can wait 18 months-2 years."
